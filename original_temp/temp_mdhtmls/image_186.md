Money goes from your pocket to the stock market by purchasing shares of a company's stock. When you buy shares, you become a shareholder of that company. As a shareholder, you own a small piece of the company and are entitled to a portion of its profits. The company uses the money it receives from selling its stock to fund its operations, invest in new projects, and pay dividends to shareholders. Over time, the value of your shares may increase or decrease based on the company's performance and the overall state of the stock market.
