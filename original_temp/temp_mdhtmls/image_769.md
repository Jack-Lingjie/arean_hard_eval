In a minute, approximately 19.5 billion text messages are sent globally. This number is derived from the following steps:

1. First, we need to determine the total number of text messages sent globally in a year. According to a report by Statista, in 2020, approximately 8.3 trillion text messages were sent worldwide.

2. Next, we need to convert this number from a yearly figure to a daily figure. To do this, we divide the yearly number by 365 (the number of days in a year). This gives us approximately 22.7 billion text messages sent daily.

3. Now, we need to convert this daily figure to a per-minute figure. To do this, we divide the daily number by 1440 (the number of minutes in a day). This gives us approximately 19.5 billion text messages sent globally in a minute.

4. Finally, we can conclude that in a minute, approximately 19.5 billion text messages are sent globally.

In summary, by following these steps, we can determine that in a minute, approximately 19.5 billion text messages are sent globally. This number is derived from the total number of text messages sent globally in a year, which is then converted to a daily figure and finally to a per-minute figure.
