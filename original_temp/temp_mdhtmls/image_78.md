The octane rating of gasoline refers to its ability to resist engine knocking or pinging, which can occur when the air-fuel mixture in the engine burns too quickly. The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the gasoline is to engine knocking. Gasoline with a higher octane rating is typically used in high-performance engines or when the engine is under heavy load, such as during acceleration or towing. The different octane values of gasoline are as follows:

* Regular gasoline: 87 octane
* Mid-grade gasoline: 89-90 octane
* Premium gasoline: 91-94 octane
* Racing gasoline: 100+ octane

It's important to note that using a gasoline with a higher octane rating than what is recommended for your engine can actually be harmful, as it can cause engine damage due to excessive pressure and heat. Always consult your vehicle's owner's manual or a qualified mechanic to determine the appropriate octane rating for your engine.
