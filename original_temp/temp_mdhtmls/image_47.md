Of course! Mine Frite is a popular Mauritian street food dish that consists of deep-fried dough balls. Here's a simple recipe for you to try:

Ingredients:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup milk

Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the warm water, vegetable oil, sugar, vanilla extract, and milk. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until a soft dough forms.

3. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.

4. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. The oil should be about 2 inches deep and hot enough to sizzle when a small piece of dough is added.

5. Roll the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Flatten each ball slightly with your fingers.

6. Carefully add the dough balls to the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the Mine Frites until they are golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.

7. Remove the Mine Frites from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

8. Serve the Mine Frites hot, sprinkled with a little bit of salt if desired.

Enjoy your delicious Mauritian treat!
