The formula to find the distance between the sun and Earth is: Distance = (Sum of distances during solar eclipse) / (Number of solar eclipses per year)
In this case, the sum of distances during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometers, and the number of solar eclipses per year is approximately 2.5 (based on historical data). Therefore, the distance between the sun and Earth is:
Distance = 1059 kilometers / 2.5 solar eclipses per year = 425.6 kilometers
The eclipse will last for approximately 2.5 years, since there are 2.5 solar eclipses per year.
