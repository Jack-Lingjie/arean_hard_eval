In Wyoming, public nudity is generally illegal under certain circumstances. According to Wyoming Statutes, Title 6, Chapter 2, Section 6-2-301, it is unlawful for any person to appear in any public place in a state of nudity. This statute defines nudity as "the showing of the human male or female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering, the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple, or the showing of the covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state." However, there are some exceptions to this law, such as when nudity is part of a religious, educational, or artistic performance, or when it is necessary for medical treatment or research. Additionally, there are some areas where public nudity is allowed, such as on private property with the owner's permission or at designated nude beaches. It is important to note that the specific circumstances and locations where public nudity is allowed may vary, so it is always best to check with local authorities or consult an attorney for more information.
