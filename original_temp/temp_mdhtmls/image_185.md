To calculate the cost of fuel for a 14-mile journey in a car with 48 mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon, and there is heavy traffic for half the journey, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance traveled during the heavy traffic: 14 miles / 2 = 7 miles

2. Calculate the distance traveled during the light traffic: 14 miles - 7 miles = 7 miles

3. Calculate the fuel consumption during the heavy traffic: 7 miles / 48 mpg = 0.1458333 gallons

4. Calculate the fuel consumption during the light traffic: 7 miles / 48 mpg = 0.1458333 gallons

5. Calculate the total fuel consumption: 0.1458333 gallons + 0.1458333 gallons = 0.2916667 gallons

6. Calculate the cost of fuel: 0.2916667 gallons x 625 pence per gallon = £1.82

Therefore, the cost of fuel for a 14-mile journey in a car with 48 mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon, and there is heavy traffic for half the journey is £1.82.
