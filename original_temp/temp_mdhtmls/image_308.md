There are several reasons why people still enjoy film photography despite the convenience and higher quality of digital cameras and mobile phones. Here are some of the main reasons:

1. Aesthetic appeal: Many people appreciate the unique look and feel of film photographs, which can be more grainy, softer, and have a more natural color palette compared to digital images. This can create a nostalgic or vintage feel that some people find appealing.

2. Creative control: With film photography, there is a limited number of shots that can be taken before the film is used up, which can encourage photographers to be more deliberate and thoughtful about each shot. This can lead to more creative and unique images.

3. Learning experience: Film photography can be a great learning experience for photographers, as it requires a deeper understanding of exposure, composition, and other technical aspects of photography. This can help photographers develop their skills and improve their overall photography abilities.

4. Nostalgia: For some people, film photography evokes a sense of nostalgia and reminds them of a simpler time when photography was more analog and less digital. This can be a comforting and enjoyable experience for some people.

5. Collectability: Film photographs can be collected and displayed in physical albums or frames, which can be a fun and unique way to showcase one's photography skills. This can also be a great way to preserve memories and share them with others.

Overall, while digital cameras and mobile phones may be more convenient and generate higher quality of photos, film photography still has its own unique appeal and benefits that many people enjoy.
