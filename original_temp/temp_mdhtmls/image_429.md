HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages that serve different purposes in web development. Here are the key differences between them:

1. Purpose: HTML is a markup language used to structure and present content on a web page, while JavaScript is a scripting language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

2. Syntax: HTML uses tags to define the structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images. JavaScript uses a combination of keywords, variables, functions, and statements to create interactive elements on a web page.

3. Execution: HTML is a static language that is rendered by the browser and does not require any additional processing. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a client-side scripting language that is executed by the browser after the HTML has been rendered.

4. Interactivity: HTML provides basic structural elements for a web page, but it lacks the ability to add interactivity. JavaScript, however, can be used to create dynamic elements such as forms, animations, and interactive maps.

5. Security: HTML is a safe language that cannot be used to access or modify sensitive data on a user's computer. JavaScript, however, can be used to access and modify data on a user's computer, which can pose a security risk if not properly secured.

In summary, HTML and JavaScript are two different programming languages that serve different purposes in web development. HTML is used to structure and present content on a web page, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
