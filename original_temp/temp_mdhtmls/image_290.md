Here's a script that finds the nearest character to the player and teleports them to that character using the Roblox Luau language:

local Players = game:GetService("Players")

-- Function to get the nearest character to the player
local function getNearestCharacter()
    local nearestCharacter = nil
    local nearestDistance = math.huge

    for _, player in pairs(Players:GetPlayers()) do
        if player ~= game.Players.LocalPlayer then
            local character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
            local distance = (game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.Position - character.HumanoidRootPart.Position).Magnitude

            if distance < nearestDistance then
                nearestDistance = distance
                nearestCharacter = character
            end
        end
    end

    return nearestCharacter
end

-- Main code
local nearestCharacter = getNearestCharacter()

if nearestCharacter then
    game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = nearestCharacter.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame
end
