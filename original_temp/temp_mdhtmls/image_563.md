Answer 1 is correct. The ActiveState Recipes site provides a cross-platform solution for reading a single character from user input. The code uses the `sys.stdin` module to read a single character from the user input, and then returns it as a string. This solution works on Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it a suitable option for cross-platform development. Answer 2 is incorrect. The `input()` function in Python reads a line of input from the user, not a single character. It is used to hold the screen and wait for user input, but it does not provide a way to read a single character.
