It's a common phenomenon that watching multiple episodes of a TV show feels less effortful than watching a movie of the same duration. This is because TV shows are typically designed to be consumed in smaller, more digestible chunks, with breaks in between episodes. This allows the brain to rest and process the information, making it feel less taxing on the mind. Additionally, TV shows often have more commercial breaks, which can provide a natural pause and allow the viewer to take a break. In contrast, movies are typically designed to be consumed in one sitting, which can be more mentally demanding.
