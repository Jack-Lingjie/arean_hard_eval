To help our man, let's first calculate the monthly decrease in the value of his old car and the secondhand car. The old car's value will decrease by 1.5% per month, so its value after one month will be $2000 - ($2000 * 1.5%) = $1980. Similarly, the secondhand car's value will decrease by 1.5% + 0.5% = 2% per month, so its value after one month will be $8000 - ($8000 * 2%) = $7840.

Now, let's calculate how many months it will take our man to save up enough money to buy the secondhand car. He wants to save $1000 per month, so he will have saved $1000 * n = $8000 after n months, where n is the number of months. Solving for n, we get n = $8000 / $1000 = 8 months.

Finally, let's calculate how much money our man will have left over after buying the secondhand car. After 8 months, the value of his old car will have decreased to $2000 - ($2000 * 8 * 1.5%) = $1904. So, he will have $8000 - $1904 = $6096 left over.

In summary, it will take our man 8 months to save up enough money to buy the secondhand car, and he will have $6096 left over after buying it.
