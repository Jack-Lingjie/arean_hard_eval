No, a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 crane cannot hypothetically lift Mount Everest. Mount Everest, also known as Chomolungma, is the highest mountain in the world, with a peak elevation of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet). The Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 crane has a maximum lifting capacity of 1,200 tons, which is significantly less than the weight of Mount Everest. Additionally, the crane's maximum lifting height is 100 meters, which is not nearly high enough to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Therefore, it is impossible for a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 crane to lift Mount Everest.
