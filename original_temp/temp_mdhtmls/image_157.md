 Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a philosopher, essayist, and risk analyst, has expressed skepticism about the concept of market efficiency. He argues that markets are not always efficient and that there are instances where they can be manipulated or influenced by external factors. Taleb believes that the idea of market efficiency is based on a flawed assumption that all market participants have access to the same information and that all decisions are made rationally. He argues that this assumption is not always true and that there are instances where market participants have an informational advantage or make irrational decisions. Taleb's views on market efficiency have been influential in the field of finance and have led to a greater focus on the role of uncertainty and risk in financial markets.
