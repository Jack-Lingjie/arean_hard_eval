No, it is not true that the native Australians were prisoners of England. The indigenous people of Australia, known as Aboriginal Australians, have a long and complex history that predates European colonization. They were not prisoners of England, but rather the original inhabitants of the continent. The colonization of Australia by the British began in the late 18th century, and the Aboriginal people experienced significant cultural, social, and economic changes as a result. However, they have maintained their unique cultural identity and continue to be an important part of Australian society today.
