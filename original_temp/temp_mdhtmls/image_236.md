African governments are actively working to improve air traffic connectivity through various initiatives and projects. Some of the key efforts include:

1. Infrastructure development: African governments are investing in the construction and modernization of airports, runways, and air traffic control systems to enhance air traffic connectivity. This includes the expansion of existing airports, the construction of new ones, and the improvement of air navigation facilities.

2. Regional cooperation: African governments are collaborating with each other to establish regional air transport agreements and protocols that facilitate the movement of passengers and cargo across borders. This includes the establishment of open skies policies, the harmonization of air traffic regulations, and the creation of a single African aviation market.

3. Digitalization: African governments are embracing digital technologies to improve air traffic connectivity. This includes the implementation of electronic flight planning systems, the use of satellite-based navigation systems, and the adoption of advanced communication technologies such as 5G.

4. Capacity building: African governments are investing in the training and development of aviation personnel to enhance air traffic connectivity. This includes the training of air traffic controllers, pilots, and other aviation professionals, as well as the establishment of aviation training centers and academies.

5. Public-private partnerships: African governments are partnering with private sector players to improve air traffic connectivity. This includes the establishment of public-private partnerships to finance and operate airports, the development of joint ventures to provide air traffic services, and the creation of partnerships to promote air travel and tourism.

Overall, African governments are committed to improving air traffic connectivity to support economic growth, trade, and tourism in the region. By investing in infrastructure, regional cooperation, digitalization, capacity building, and public-private partnerships, African governments are working to create a more connected and efficient air transport system that benefits both passengers and businesses.
