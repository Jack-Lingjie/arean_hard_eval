Certainly! Here's a simple and delicious recipe for Milanesa de Peceto, an Argentinian-style breaded and fried beef cutlet:

Ingredients:

* 1 lb (450g) beef tenderloin, sliced into 4-6 thin cutlets
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs, beaten
* 1 cup breadcrumbs
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp paprika
* Vegetable oil, for frying

Instructions:

1. Season the beef cutlets with salt and pepper on both sides. Set aside.

2. In three separate shallow dishes, place the flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs. Add the salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to the breadcrumbs.

3. Dredge each cutlet in the flour, shaking off any excess. Then, dip the cutlet in the beaten eggs, letting any excess drip off. Finally, coat the cutlet in the seasoned breadcrumbs, pressing gently to help the breadcrumbs adhere.

4. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Once the oil is hot, add the breaded cutlets to the skillet, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.

5. Transfer the cooked cutlets to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve hot with your favorite sides, such as mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad.

Enjoy your delicious Milanesa de Peceto!
