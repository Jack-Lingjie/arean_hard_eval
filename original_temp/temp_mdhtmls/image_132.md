Banks cannot use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses because cash is a highly liquid asset that can be easily accessed and withdrawn by depositors. If a bank were to use cash as capital, it would be vulnerable to a run on deposits, where depositors withdraw their funds en masse, leading to a liquidity crisis. This could result in the bank being unable to meet its obligations and potentially fail. Therefore, banks are required to hold capital in the form of equity or retained earnings, which are less liquid and more stable, to absorb potential losses and maintain financial stability.
