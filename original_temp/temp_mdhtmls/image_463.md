Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires two separate forms of identification to verify a user's identity. This adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access your information. Here's how it works:

1. **Something you know:** This is typically a password or PIN that you create and use to log in to your account. It's important to choose a strong password that is unique to each account and not easily guessable.

2. **Something you have:** This is a physical device or token that generates a one-time code that you enter along with your password to verify your identity. Examples of this include a security key, a mobile app, or a hardware token.

3. **Something you are:** This is a biometric factor, such as a fingerprint, facial recognition, or voice recognition, that is unique to you and can be used to verify your identity.

When you log in to an account that uses 2FA, you will be prompted to enter your password and then provide the second factor, such as a one-time code generated by a mobile app or a hardware token. This ensures that even if someone knows your password, they will not be able to access your account without the second factor.

2FA is an effective way to protect your online accounts from unauthorized access, but it's important to remember that it's not foolproof. It's still important to use strong passwords and to be cautious about the websites and apps you use to store sensitive information.
