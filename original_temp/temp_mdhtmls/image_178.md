Online gambling in India is not entirely legal. While there is no specific law that prohibits online gambling, it is regulated by the Public Gambling Act of 1867, which prohibits running or visiting a public gambling house. However, the interpretation of this law varies from state to state, and some states have their own gambling laws. It is important to check the local laws and regulations before engaging in online gambling activities in India.
