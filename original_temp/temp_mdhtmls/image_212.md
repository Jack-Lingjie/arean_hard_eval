It is not necessary to create a separate presale contract for your Defi project. Instead, you can use a single smart contract that includes both the main token contract and the presale functionality. This approach allows you to manage the token supply and distribution in a single place, making it easier to track and control the token sale process. Additionally, it can help to reduce the complexity and cost of deploying multiple contracts. However, it is important to ensure that the presale functionality is properly implemented and secured to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.
