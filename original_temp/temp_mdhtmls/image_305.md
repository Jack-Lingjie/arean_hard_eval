Hearken, thou who holdeth my daughters captive! I, Bryan Mills, doth demand their release, or else shall I wreak vengeance upon thee and thy kin! Knowest thou not that I am a man of great skill in the arts of war, and that I shall not rest until my daughters are returned to me unharmed? Fie upon thee, thou cowardly knave! Release my daughters, or face the consequences of my wrath!
