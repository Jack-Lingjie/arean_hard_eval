Antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called omnidirectional antennas. These antennas radiate energy equally in all directions in the horizontal plane, but not in the vertical plane. They are commonly used in applications where coverage is required in all directions, such as in wireless networking, amateur radio, and public safety communications.
