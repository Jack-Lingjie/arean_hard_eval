The theory of sexual selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, explains the evolution of traits that are not directly related to survival but are advantageous in attracting mates. These traits, known as secondary sexual characteristics, can include physical features, behaviors, and vocalizations. An example of sexual selection is the peacock's elaborate tail feathers, which are thought to have evolved through female mate choice. Females prefer males with larger, more colorful tails, which indicates good health and genetic quality. This preference leads to the evolution of the trait, as males with larger tails are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation.
