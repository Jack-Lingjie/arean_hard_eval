Governments can utilize fiscal and monetary policies to combat economic recessions in several ways. Here are some key strategies:

1. Fiscal Policy: Governments can increase government spending or reduce taxes to stimulate the economy. This can help boost consumer spending and investment, which can lead to increased economic activity and job creation.

2. Monetary Policy: Central banks can lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending. This can also help to increase the money supply, which can lead to lower prices and increased economic activity.

3. Stimulus Packages: Governments can implement stimulus packages to provide financial support to businesses and individuals. This can include tax breaks, grants, and loans to help businesses stay afloat during difficult times.

4. Infrastructure Investment: Governments can invest in infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, and public transportation, to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

5. Trade Policies: Governments can implement trade policies to encourage international trade and investment. This can help to increase exports and imports, which can lead to increased economic activity and job creation.

6. Social Safety Net: Governments can provide social safety net programs, such as unemployment benefits and food stamps, to help individuals and families during difficult times.

7. Financial Regulation: Governments can implement financial regulations to prevent excessive risk-taking and speculation in financial markets. This can help to prevent financial crises and protect the economy from downturns.

Overall, governments can utilize a combination of fiscal and monetary policies to combat economic recessions. By implementing these strategies, governments can help to stabilize the economy and promote economic growth.
