A reinforcement learning system that can learn how to play Atari games typically consists of the following components:

1. Environment: The Atari game environment, which provides the agent with observations and rewards based on its actions.

2. Agent: The reinforcement learning agent, which takes actions in the environment and receives rewards based on its performance.

3. Policy: The agent's decision-making strategy, which determines the actions it takes based on its observations.

4. Value Function: A function that estimates the expected return of taking a particular action in a given state.

5. Exploration vs. Exploitation: The trade-off between exploring new actions and exploiting known actions that have high expected returns.

6. Reward Function: A function that assigns a numerical value to the agent's actions, based on their impact on the environment.

7. Learning Algorithm: The algorithm used to update the agent's policy and value function based on the rewards it receives.

8. Hyperparameters: Tunable parameters that control the learning process, such as the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate.

9. Evaluation: A method for assessing the agent's performance, such as by playing against a human or another agent.

10. Visualization: Tools for visualizing the agent's behavior and performance, such as by plotting its policy or value function.
