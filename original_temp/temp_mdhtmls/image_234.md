Most of the basic functions of current virtualization software are inherited from early VM OS. Virtualization software is now represented as hypervisors. Hardware virtualization enables cloud providers to share resources effectively with customers by creating an illusion of dedicated computing, storage, and networking on a computing infrastructure. The concept of virtualization is physically implemented using hypervisor modules, and the operation and processing of hypervisors are materialized by OSS. In other words, hypervisor modules are installed on top of OSS, which act as an interface between hardware units and hypervisor packages.
