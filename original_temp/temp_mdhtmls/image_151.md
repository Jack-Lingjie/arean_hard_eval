To improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge, you can follow these steps:

1. Collect and annotate a diverse dataset: Start by collecting a diverse dataset that includes various objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. Then, annotate the dataset with precise bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each object instance.

2. Train a baseline model: Train a baseline instance segmentation model on the annotated dataset. This will give you a starting point for comparison and improvement.

3. Analyze the model's performance: Analyze the model's performance on the test set using standard metrics such as AP (Average Precision) and F1 score. Identify the areas where the model performs poorly and understand the reasons behind it.

4. Incorporate human knowledge: Incorporate human knowledge into the model by using techniques such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and domain adaptation. For example, you can use pre-trained models on large datasets to initialize your model's weights, or use synthetic data to augment the training set.

5. Evaluate the model's performance: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set again using the same metrics as before. Compare the results with the baseline model and identify the improvements made by incorporating human knowledge.

6. Iterate and refine: Iterate through the above steps to refine the model's performance further. Continuously evaluate the model's performance and make adjustments based on the feedback from human experts.

By following these steps, you can improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge and achieve better results in object detection and segmentation tasks.
