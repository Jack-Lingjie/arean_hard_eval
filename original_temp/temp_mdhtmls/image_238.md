It seems that the developer tools shortcut combination of `Ctrl + Shift + I` is not working on the website you mentioned. This could be due to a JavaScript code that is intercepting the keyboard event and preventing the default behavior of opening the developer tools. However, there are alternative ways to open the developer tools in Chrome. You can try the following:

1. Right-click anywhere on the webpage and select "Inspect" from the context menu.
2. Press `F12` on your keyboard to open the developer tools.
3. Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + J` to open the console.
4. Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + C` to open the element inspector.

If none of these methods work, you can try clearing your browser cache and cookies, or using a different browser altogether.
