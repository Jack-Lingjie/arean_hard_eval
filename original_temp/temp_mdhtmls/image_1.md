US states get their names from a variety of sources, including Native American languages, European explorers and settlers, and historical figures. Some states were named after prominent rivers, such as the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri. Others were named after Native American tribes, such as the Dakota, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. Some states were named after European explorers and settlers, such as Virginia, Florida, and California. And still others were named after historical figures, such as New York, named after the Duke of York, and Texas, named after the Caddo word "tejas," meaning "friends" or "allies."
