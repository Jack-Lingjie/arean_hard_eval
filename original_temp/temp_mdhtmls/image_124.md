 Sure! Here are some tips to help you cook a juicy, medium-rare steak:

1. Choose the right cut: Opt for a tender cut of beef, such as ribeye, filet mignon, or New York strip. These cuts are known for their tenderness and flavor.

2. Let the steak come to room temperature: Take the steak out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking. This allows the meat to cook more evenly and prevents it from becoming tough.

3. Season the steak: Season the steak with salt and pepper, or your favorite seasoning blend, at least 30 minutes before cooking. This allows the seasoning to penetrate the meat and enhance the flavor.

4. Preheat the pan: Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until it's smoking hot. This helps to sear the steak and lock in the juices.

5. Sear the steak: Add the steak to the hot pan and sear it for 2-3 minutes per side, or until a golden-brown crust forms. This helps to create a flavorful crust and seal in the juices.

6. Finish cooking in the oven: Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook the steak for an additional 3-5 minutes for medium-rare, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the steak is cooked to the correct temperature.

7. Let the steak rest: Remove the steak from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a juicy and tender steak.

8. Slice against the grain: Slice the steak against the grain to ensure that it remains tender and juicy.

By following these tips, you can cook a juicy, medium-rare steak that is sure to impress your guests. Enjoy!
