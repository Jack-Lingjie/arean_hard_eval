There is no definitive answer to the question of how many words are spoken daily on Earth. However, we can estimate this number by considering the following factors:

1. Population: The number of people on Earth is approximately 7.8 billion. This means that there are a lot of potential speakers, which could contribute to a high number of words spoken daily.

2. Language diversity: There are over 7,000 languages spoken on Earth, each with its own unique vocabulary and grammar. This means that the total number of words spoken daily could be quite large, as each language has its own set of words.

3. Frequency of speech: People speak at different rates, depending on their culture, language, and personal preferences. Some people may speak more frequently than others, which could contribute to a higher number of words spoken daily.

4. Context: The context in which words are spoken can also affect the number of words spoken daily. For example, if people are engaged in a conversation, they may speak more words than if they are simply listening to someone else speak.

5. Technology: The use of technology, such as smartphones and computers, has also increased the number of words spoken daily. People can now communicate with each other through text messages, emails, and social media, which can contribute to a higher number of words spoken daily.

Based on these factors, it is difficult to estimate the exact number of words spoken daily on Earth. However, it is likely that the number is quite large, as there are so many potential speakers and languages, and the use of technology has increased the number of words spoken daily.
