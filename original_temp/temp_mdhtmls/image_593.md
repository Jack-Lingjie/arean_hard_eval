When faced with a sudden temperature change, it's important to adjust travel plans accordingly to ensure safety and comfort. Here are some tips to consider:

1. Check the weather forecast: Before heading out, check the weather forecast to get an idea of the temperature and any potential weather conditions. This will help you plan your travel accordingly.

2. Dress appropriately: Layer your clothing to accommodate the changing temperatures. Wear a base layer to keep you warm, a middle layer for insulation, and an outer layer for protection from the elements.

3. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially if you're engaging in physical activity. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and other health issues.

4. Wear sunscreen: Even on cloudy days, the sun's rays can still cause sunburn. Apply sunscreen with a high SPF to protect your skin from harmful UV rays.

5. Be cautious of slippery surfaces: Sudden temperature changes can cause ice and snow to form, making surfaces slippery. Take extra caution when walking or driving, and wear appropriate footwear with good traction.

6. Avoid strenuous activity: If the temperature is extremely cold, avoid strenuous activity to prevent hypothermia. Instead, opt for low-impact activities like walking or light jogging.

7. Seek shelter: If the temperature drops significantly, seek shelter in a warm, dry place. This could be a building, car, or even a tent.

8. Be aware of the risks: Sudden temperature changes can cause health issues like hypothermia, frostbite, and dehydration. Be aware of the risks and take necessary precautions to stay safe.

By following these tips, you can adjust your travel plans to accommodate sudden temperature changes and ensure your safety and comfort.
