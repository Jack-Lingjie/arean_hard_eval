Gremolata is a traditional Italian condiment made from a mixture of finely chopped parsley, garlic, and lemon zest. It is often used as a garnish or topping for various dishes, such as roasted meats, fish, and vegetables. The combination of fresh herbs, garlic, and citrus adds a bright, zesty flavor to the dish, enhancing its overall taste and aroma. Gremolata can also be used as a seasoning for soups, stews, and sauces.
