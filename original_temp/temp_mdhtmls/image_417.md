In TypeScript, you can use the `as` operator to assert a type, which tells the type system that you know the value will have a specific type, even though it may have multiple types in theory. For example:

```typescript
let value: string | number;
value = 42; // value is now of type number

// Assert that value is a string
value = value as string; // value is now of type string
```

In this example, the `as` operator is used to assert that `value` is a string, even though it may have been a number before. This can be useful when you have a value that may have multiple types, but you know it will only have one specific type in practice.
