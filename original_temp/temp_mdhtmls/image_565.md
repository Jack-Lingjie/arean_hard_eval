Design a problem that involves finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of integers. Given an array of size n, find the length of the longest subsequence of distinct elements that are sorted in increasing order. For example, given the array [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15], the longest increasing subsequence is [0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15] with a length of 6. Constraints: n <= 10000, all elements in the array are non-negative integers.
