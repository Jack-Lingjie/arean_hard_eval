To find the length of the line segment, we can use the distance formula. The distance formula is given by: d = √(x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2

In this case, the endpoints of the line segment are (2, -2) and (10, 4). Let's plug these values into the distance formula:

d = √(10 - 2)2 + (4 - (-2))2
d = √82 + 62
d = √64 + 36
d = √100
d = 10

Therefore, the length of the line segment is 10 units.
