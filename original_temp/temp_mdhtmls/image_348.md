As the Norse Goddess Freyja, I embody the essence of love, beauty, fertility, and war. I am known for my enchanting beauty, and my golden necklace, Brisingamen, which grants me the power to see into the future. I am a skilled warrior, leading the Valkyries in their selection of heroes to fight in the afterlife. I am also a goddess of fertility, and my sacred animals are the cats and the boar. I am a powerful and complex deity, beloved by many.
