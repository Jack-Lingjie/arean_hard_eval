As a business consultant, I would start the project by conducting a thorough analysis of Zegna's current ecommerce operations, digital marketing initiatives, and commercial approach in the United States. To gain valuable insights, I would interview several key stakeholders, including the following:

- What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the ecommerce team?
- What are the top-selling products and categories?
- How do you currently acquire and retain customers?
- What are the main pain points for customers when shopping on the website?
- What are the main competitors in the market, and how do they differentiate themselves?

2. Digital Marketing Manager: I would ask the digital marketing manager about their current strategies, challenges, and opportunities in the US market. Some specific questions I would ask include:

- What are the main channels you use to reach customers (e.g., social media, email, search engine optimization)?
- What are the key metrics you use to measure the success of your campaigns?
- What are the main challenges you face in reaching and engaging customers?
- What are the main opportunities you see for growth in the US market?

3. Customer Service Manager: I would ask the customer service manager about their current strategies, challenges, and opportunities in the US market. Some specific questions I would ask include:
