Sailing through the turquoise sea,
A family's dream come true,
Bora Bora's beauty, so serene,
A paradise for all to view.

The gentle breeze, a melody,
Carrying us across the bay,
Sun-kissed faces, laughter free,
A moment to cherish, day by day.

The islands, like jewels in the sun,
A postcard-perfect scene,
A family's bond, forever won,
In Bora Bora's embrace.

The waves, a symphony of sound,
A rhythm that soothes and calms,
A family's love, a bond profound,
In Bora Bora's tranquil palms.

The sunsets, a painter's dream,
A canvas of colors bright,
A family's memories, to keep,
In Bora Bora's golden light.

The stars, a celestial show,
A night sky, so vast and clear,
A family's love, forever grow,
In Bora Bora's tranquil air.

The sand, a whispering breeze,
A gentle caress, so soft and fine,
A family's bond, forever at ease,
In Bora Bora's tropical line.

The coral reefs, a wonderland,
A world beneath the sea,
A family's adventure, to explore,
In Bora Bora's tropical sea.

The dolphins, a playful dance,
A family's joy, so pure and true,
A moment to cherish, day by day,
In Bora Bora's tropical view.

The family, a bond so strong,
A love that knows no bounds,
A journey, a memory long,
In Bora Bora's tropical grounds.

The family, a bond so true,
A love that knows no end,
A journey, a memory new,
In Bora Bora's tropical bend.
