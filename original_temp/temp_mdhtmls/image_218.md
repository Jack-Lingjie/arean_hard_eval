As an SEO expert, I would recommend targeting the following keywords for a screenwriting software:

1. Screenwriting software
2. Screenwriting software free
3. Screenwriting software for Mac
4. Screenwriting software for Windows
5. Screenwriting software for beginners
6. Screenwriting software for professionals
7. Screenwriting software for film
8. Screenwriting software for TV
9. Screenwriting software for stage plays
10. Screenwriting software for animation

These keywords are highly relevant to the target audience of screenwriters and filmmakers, and they have a high search volume, making them valuable for SEO purposes. Additionally, these keywords are broad enough to cover a range of screenwriting software options, but specific enough to target a particular niche. By targeting these keywords, a screenwriting software can improve its visibility in search engine results and attract more potential users.
