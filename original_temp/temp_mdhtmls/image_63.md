Making apple juice at home is a simple and rewarding process. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Wash and peel the apples: Wash the apples thoroughly under running water, then peel them using a vegetable peeler or a paring knife. Discard the cores and any bruised or damaged parts.

2. Chop the apples: Cut the peeled apples into small pieces, about 1 inch in size. This will help the apples release their juices more easily.

3. Place the apples in a pot: Add the chopped apples to a large pot, along with a few cups of water. The amount of water you use will depend on how thick or thin you want your juice to be. For a thicker juice, use less water; for a thinner juice, use more water.

4. Bring the mixture to a boil: Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the apples are soft and tender.

5. Strain the mixture: Use a fine-mesh strainer or a cheesecloth to strain the mixture, separating the juice from the pulp and skin. You can discard the pulp and skin, or use it to make apple sauce or other recipes.

6. Sweeten the juice (optional): If you want your juice to be sweeter, you can add a little bit of sugar or honey to taste. Stir well to combine.

7. Serve and enjoy: Pour the juice into glasses and serve it chilled. You can also store it in the refrigerator for up to a week.

That's it! With these simple steps, you can make delicious, homemade apple juice in no time. Enjoy!
