Polar bears have several adaptations that help them stay warm in the Arctic winters. These include a thick layer of insulating blubber, a dense fur coat, and a unique blood circulation system that helps conserve body heat. Additionally, polar bears have a high metabolic rate, which generates heat as they digest food. They also hibernate during the coldest months, reducing their energy expenditure and conserving heat.
