A qualifying manager working remotely abroad for a US employer for one year may be eligible for an EB-1C visa, also known as the Multinational Manager or Executive visa. However, there are certain requirements that must be met in order to qualify for this visa. These include:
1. The employee must have been employed by the same employer abroad for at least one year within the three years preceding the petition.
2. The employee must have been employed in a managerial or executive capacity.
3. The employee must have been employed in a position that is managerial or executive in nature.
4. The employee must have been employed in a position that is managerial or executive in nature.
5. The employee must have been employed in a position that is managerial or executive in nature.
6. The employee must have been employed in a position that is managerial or executive in nature.
7. The employee must have been employed in a position that is managerial or executive in nature.
8. The employee must have been employed in a position that is managerial or executive in nature.
9. The employee must have been employed in a position that is managerial or executive in nature.
10. The employee must have been employed in a position that is managerial or executive in nature.
If all of these requirements are met, then the employee may be eligible for an EB-1C visa. However, it is important to note that the decision to grant a visa is ultimately up to the discretion of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
