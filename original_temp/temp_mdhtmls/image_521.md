It sounds like you've already made up your mind about leaving your friend behind, but I'll provide some advice for a potential amicable split. First, try to have a calm and open conversation with your friend. Express your concerns about the lack of communication and enjoyment during the trip. Be honest about how his behavior is affecting you and ask if there's anything you can do to improve the situation. Listen to his perspective and try to understand his point of view. If he's unwilling to change or compromise, it may be time to part ways. However, if he's willing to work on the situation, consider giving it another chance. If you decide to go your separate ways, make sure to communicate clearly and respectfully. Wish him well and let him know that you appreciate the time you've spent together. Remember, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and happiness, so don't hesitate to make a decision that's best for you.
