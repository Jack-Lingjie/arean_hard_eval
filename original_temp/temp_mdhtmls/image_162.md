INT. BEFFY'S BEACH CLUB - DAY

The camera pans across the Miami Beach Club, Beefy's, as the sun beats down on the sand and the ocean waves crash against the shore. The club is a lively, colorful place, with palm trees swaying in the breeze and a DJ spinning upbeat music. The pool area is packed with people, lounging on chairs and floating in the water, while the bar is bustling with activity.

In the center of the action is Beefy, the British owner of the club, who is known for his larger-than-life personality and his love of a good party. He is a tall, muscular man with a shaved head and a thick British accent, and he is wearing a bright yellow tank top and a pair of sunglasses.

JdeG, a young, energetic bartender, is working behind the bar, mixing drinks and chatting with the customers. He is a friendly, outgoing guy with a mischievous grin, and he is wearing a tight-fitting white t-shirt and a pair of shorts.

SophieSnazz, a blonde British woman, is also working behind the bar. She is a confident, stylish woman with a sharp sense of humor, and she is wearing a tight-fitting black dress and a pair of high heels.

As the scene unfolds, we see Beefy, JdeG, and SophieSnazz interacting with the customers, serving drinks, and having a good time. The music is upbeat and energetic, and the atmosphere is lively and fun.

Suddenly, a group of rowdy customers approaches the bar, demanding drinks and causing a commotion. Beefy, JdeG, and SophieSnazz handle the situation with ease, serving the customers quickly and efficiently while keeping their cool.

As the scene comes to a close, we see Beefy, JdeG, and SophieSnazz laughing and chatting together, enjoying the good times and the good vibes of Beefy's Beach Club. The camera pans out, revealing the beautiful Miami skyline in the distance, and the credits roll.
