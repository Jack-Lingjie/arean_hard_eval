It's understandable that your friend is feeling sad about their dog's passing. Here are some ways you can comfort them:

1. Listen: Allow your friend to express their emotions and feelings. Don't try to fix the situation or offer solutions. Just be a supportive listener.

2. Offer physical comfort: Hug your friend, hold their hand, or sit with them. Physical touch can be a powerful way to provide comfort and support.

3. Share memories: Reminisce about the good times you had with the dog. This can help your friend feel better and remember the dog in a positive light.

4. Offer practical help: Offer to help with tasks like cleaning up the dog's belongings or taking care of other pets. This can take some of the burden off your friend and show that you care.

5. Be patient: Grief takes time, and there's no set timeline for how long it will last. Be patient with your friend and allow them to grieve at their own pace.

6. Check in: Follow up with your friend regularly to see how they're doing. This can help them feel supported and less alone during this difficult time.

Remember, there's no one right way to comfort someone who's grieving. Just be there for your friend and offer your support in whatever way feels most natural to you.
