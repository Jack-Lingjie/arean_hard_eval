To prepare chewy chocolate chip cookies, you will need the following ingredients:

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Here are the steps to prepare chewy chocolate chip cookies:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and beat until well combined.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.
6. Fold in the chocolate chips.
7. Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
8. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers will still look slightly underbaked.
9. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
10. Enjoy your chewy chocolate chip cookies!
