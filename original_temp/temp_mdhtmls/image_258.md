It is not possible to appear as if you are actively listening while you are actually sleeping during a video call. It is important to be honest and transparent in your communication, and to prioritize your own well-being by getting enough rest. If you are feeling tired or overwhelmed, it may be helpful to take a break from the call and come back when you are feeling more alert and able to engage fully.
