Kahane's ethics of violence can be seen as echoing Fanon and Zizek's views in their discussions with the American Jewish Establishment. All three thinkers advocate for a more assertive and proactive approach to violence, particularly in response to perceived threats or injustices. They argue that violence can be a necessary and effective tool for achieving political and social change, and that it should not be shunned or avoided simply because it is morally or ethically problematic.

Kahane, like Fanon and Zizek, believes that violence can be a legitimate means of self-defense and resistance against oppression. He argues that the American Jewish Establishment has been too passive and accommodating in the face of anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination, and that a more aggressive and confrontational approach is needed to protect Jewish interests and ensure their survival.

Fanon, in his book "The Wretched of the Earth," argues that violence is a necessary and inevitable part of the struggle for liberation and self-determination. He believes that violence can be a powerful tool for breaking down the structures of oppression and creating a more just and equitable society. Zizek, in his book "Violence," similarly argues that violence can be a necessary and effective means of challenging the status quo and bringing about social and political change.

In their discussions with the American Jewish Establishment, Kahane, Fanon, and Zizek all argue that violence should not be shunned or avoided simply because it is morally or ethically problematic. They believe that violence can be a legitimate and necessary means of self-defense and resistance against oppression, and that it should be used judiciously and responsibly to achieve political and social change.
