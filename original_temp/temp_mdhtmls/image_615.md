Based on the given fact, the square of any real number is non-negative. This means that for any real number x, x^2 ≥ 0. Applying this fact to the statement, we can rewrite it as:

Statement: "For every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0"

Rewritten: "For every integer k, (k^2 + 2k + 1) ≥ 0"

Using the distributive property, we can factor out k^2 from the expression inside the parentheses:

Rewritten: "For every integer k, k^2(1 + 2/k + 1/k^2) ≥ 0"

Since k is an integer, 1/k and 1/k^2 are also integers. Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses is a sum of three non-negative integers, which is also non-negative. Thus, we can conclude that the statement is true for all integers k.
