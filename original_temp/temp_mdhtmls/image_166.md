No, MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and MEL-spectrograms are not the same thing. MFCCs are a representation of the spectral envelope of a sound, while a MEL-spectrogram is a visual representation of the frequency content of a sound over time. MFCCs are commonly used in speech recognition and music information retrieval systems, while MEL-spectrograms are used for visualizing the frequency content of sounds.
