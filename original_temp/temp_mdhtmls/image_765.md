The average human blinks approximately 16,800 times per day, which translates to about 4,800,000 blinks in a year. Over the course of a typical 70-year lifespan, this amounts to approximately 336 million blinks. This estimate is based on various studies that have measured the frequency of blinking in different age groups and under different conditions. For instance, a study published in the journal "Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics" found that adults blink an average of 15 times per minute, while children blink more frequently, at an average of 20 times per minute. Another study, published in the journal "Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science," found that the frequency of blinking decreases with age, with older adults blinking less frequently than younger adults. These findings suggest that the total number of blinks over a lifetime may vary depending on factors such as age, gender, and environmental conditions. However, the overall trend of approximately 16,800 blinks per day remains consistent across different studies.
