Volcanoes form due to the movement of tectonic plates, which are large slabs of the Earth's crust that float on top of the mantle. When these plates collide or move away from each other, the pressure and heat beneath the Earth's surface can cause magma (molten rock) to rise up through cracks and fissures in the Earth's crust. This magma can then erupt onto the surface, creating a volcano. The type of volcano that forms depends on the composition of the magma and the surrounding environment. For example, volcanoes that erupt with thick, sticky lava tend to form shield volcanoes, while those that erupt with thin, runny lava tend to form cinder cones.
