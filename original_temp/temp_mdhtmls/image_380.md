Metabolism is the process by which the body converts food into energy. It involves a series of chemical reactions that break down nutrients into smaller molecules, which can then be used by cells to produce energy. The process of metabolism is essential for maintaining the body's health and well-being, as it provides the energy needed for all bodily functions, including growth, repair, and movement. There are two main types of metabolism: catabolism, which breaks down large molecules into smaller ones, and anabolism, which builds larger molecules from smaller ones. The rate at which metabolism occurs can vary depending on a number of factors, including age, gender, and physical activity level.
