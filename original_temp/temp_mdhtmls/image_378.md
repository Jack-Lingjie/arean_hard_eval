Pirating video games is generally considered to be unethical and illegal. While it may be true that some individuals who pirate games would not have purchased them otherwise, this does not justify the act of piracy. Piracy harms the game developers and publishers who rely on sales to fund their work, and it also undermines the efforts of those who create and distribute legitimate copies of the game. Additionally, piracy can lead to the spread of malware and other security risks. It is important to support the creators of the games we enjoy by purchasing them legally.
