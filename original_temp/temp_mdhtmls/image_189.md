If people only valued and took pride in the things that were true about themselves, it would create a more authentic and self-aware society. This would lead to individuals being more confident in their own abilities and less likely to compare themselves to others. It would also foster a greater sense of empathy and understanding, as people would be more likely to appreciate the unique qualities and experiences of others. Additionally, this shift in values could lead to a more sustainable and equitable society, as people would be less likely to engage in harmful behaviors or practices that are not in line with their true selves. Overall, valuing and taking pride in the things that are true about oneself can lead to a more positive and fulfilling life for individuals and society as a whole.
