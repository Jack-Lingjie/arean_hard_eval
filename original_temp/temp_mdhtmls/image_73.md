The best way to defrost a refrigerator freezer is to turn off the freezer, remove all the food, and let the ice melt naturally. This can take several hours or even a day, depending on the size of the freezer. You can also use a hairdryer or a fan to speed up the process, but be careful not to damage the freezer with the heat. Once the ice has melted, wipe down the inside of the freezer with a damp cloth to remove any residue.
