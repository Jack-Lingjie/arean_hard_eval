If the Suez Canal had never been constructed, the global economy and trade would have been significantly impacted. The canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, was a major engineering feat that allowed for the direct passage of ships between Europe and Asia, reducing the travel time and cost of goods. Without the canal, ships would have had to take a longer and more expensive route around the African continent, which would have increased the cost of goods and slowed down trade. Additionally, the canal's construction also led to the development of the Suez Canal Zone, which became a major hub for trade and industry in the region. Without the canal, the Suez Canal Zone would not have developed, and the region would have remained underdeveloped. Overall, the construction of the Suez Canal had a significant impact on the global economy and trade, and its absence would have had far-reaching consequences.
