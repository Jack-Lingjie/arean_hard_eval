Canada was not colonized in the traditional sense. The land that is now Canada was inhabited by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years before European colonization began in the 16th century. The first European explorers and settlers arrived in the 16th and 17th centuries, but it was not until the late 18th century that the British began to establish permanent settlements in what is now Canada. The British North America Act of 1867 united the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a single federation, which eventually became the Dominion of Canada.
