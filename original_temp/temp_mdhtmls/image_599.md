In German, verbs are conjugated to indicate person, number, and tense. To end a verb in the present tense, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the infinitive form of the verb. This is the basic form of the verb, without any endings.
2. Add the appropriate ending to the infinitive form based on the subject of the sentence. The endings are as follows:
   - For the first person singular (I), add -e: ich esse (I eat)
   - For the second person singular (you), add -st: du isst (you eat)
   - For the third person singular (he/she/it), add -t: er/sie/es isst (he/she/it eats)
   - For the first person plural (we), add -en: wir essen (we eat)
   - For the second person plural (you), add -t: ihr esst (you eat)
   - For the third person plural (they), add -en: sie essen (they eat)

3. Add any additional endings or prefixes to the verb as needed to indicate tense, mood, or aspect.

For example, to say "I eat" in German, you would use the verb "essen" and add the appropriate ending for the first person singular: ich esse. To say "you eat" in German, you would use the verb "essen" and add the appropriate ending for the second person singular: du isst.
