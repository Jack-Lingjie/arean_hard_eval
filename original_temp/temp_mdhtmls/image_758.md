 Determining if someone is genuinely interested in a conversation or being polite can be challenging, but here are some indicators to consider:

1. Active listening: A genuinely interested person will actively listen to what you're saying, maintain eye contact, and respond with appropriate body language, such as nodding or smiling. They may also ask follow-up questions or seek clarification to show they're engaged in the conversation.

2. Engaged in the conversation: A person who is genuinely interested will contribute to the conversation, sharing their own thoughts, experiences, and opinions. They may also ask questions or make comments that demonstrate their curiosity and interest in the topic.

3. Maintaining the conversation: A person who is genuinely interested will work to keep the conversation going, asking follow-up questions or making relevant comments. They may also show enthusiasm and excitement about the topic, which can help to keep the conversation flowing.

4. Showing empathy: A person who is genuinely interested will show empathy and understanding towards the other person's perspective. They may ask open-ended questions, validate the other person's feelings, and offer support or encouragement.

5. Non-verbal cues: A person who is genuinely interested may exhibit non-verbal cues such as leaning in, maintaining eye contact, and using facial expressions that indicate they are engaged and interested in the conversation.

6. Follow-up: A person who is genuinely interested may follow up with the other person after the conversation, either through a phone call, email, or social media message. This can indicate that they were truly interested in the conversation and want to continue the connection.

7. Consistency: A person who is genuinely interested will consistently show interest in the conversation, even if it's not always easy to maintain. They may also seek out opportunities to continue the conversation, such as scheduling a follow-up meeting or inviting the other person to an event.

8. Authenticity: A person who is genuinely interested will be authentic and genuine in their interactions. They may share personal stories or experiences, and their responses will be sincere and honest.

9. Openness: A person who is genuinely interested will be open to new ideas and perspectives, and may be willing to challenge their own beliefs or opinions. They may also be willing to share their own vulnerabilities or weaknesses, which can help to build trust and rapport.

10. Mutual respect: A person who is genuinely interested will treat the other person with respect and dignity, and will be willing to listen to their opinions and ideas. They may also be willing to compromise or find common ground, which can help to build a strong and lasting connection.

In summary, determining if someone is genuinely interested in a conversation or simply being polite can be challenging, but by paying attention to their active listening, engagement, empathy, non-verbal cues, follow-up, consistency, authenticity, openness, and mutual respect, you can get a better sense of their level of interest.
