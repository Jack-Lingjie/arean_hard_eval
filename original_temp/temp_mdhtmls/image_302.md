Yes, this is a real story. In the 1950s, a BBC producer named Richard Cawston created a short documentary called "Spaghetti Harvest" as a prank for the BBC's Panorama program. The documentary featured a man in Italy claiming that spaghetti grew on trees, and showed footage of him climbing a tree to harvest the pasta. The segment was aired as a serious news report, and many viewers were fooled into believing that spaghetti really did grow on trees. The prank was eventually revealed, but it caused quite a stir at the time.
