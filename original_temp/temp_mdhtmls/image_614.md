The given statement is not true. Here's why:

If x is a positive integer, then x > 0. This is true.

If x is a solution to x + 3 > 4, then x > 1. This is also true.

However, the statement claims that if x is a positive integer or a solution to x + 3 > 4, then x > 0 and x > 12. This is not true, because the largest possible value of x that satisfies x + 3 > 4 is 1, and 1 is not greater than 12.

Therefore, the given statement is false.
