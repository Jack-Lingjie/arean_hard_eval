Julius Caesar and Cleopatra had a romantic relationship that was both political and personal. Cleopatra was the queen of Egypt, and Caesar was a powerful Roman general and statesman. Their relationship began in 48 BC, when Caesar arrived in Egypt to settle a dispute between the Egyptian king and his brother. Cleopatra, who was only 21 years old at the time, used her charm and intelligence to win Caesar over. She became his lover and political ally, and they had a son together named Caesarion. Their relationship was not without controversy, as some Romans saw it as a threat to their country's sovereignty. Nevertheless, Caesar and Cleopatra remained close until his assassination in 44 BC. Cleopatra later became the lover of Mark Antony, another powerful Roman general, and they had three children together. Their relationship was also marked by political intrigue and conflict, ultimately leading to their downfall.
