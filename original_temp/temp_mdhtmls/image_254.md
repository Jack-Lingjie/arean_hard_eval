Here are the key points from Jean-Claude Dev√®ze's "Challenges for African Agriculture":

1. Africa's agricultural sector faces significant challenges, including low productivity, limited access to inputs and markets, and a lack of investment in infrastructure and technology.
2. The continent's agricultural potential is vast, with abundant land and water resources, but these resources are often underutilized due to a lack of investment and capacity building.
3. Climate change is a major threat to African agriculture, with rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events all posing risks to crop yields and food security.
4. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the challenges facing African agriculture, with disruptions to supply chains, reduced demand for agricultural products, and increased food insecurity.
5. To address these challenges, African governments and development partners must prioritize investment in agriculture, including in infrastructure, technology, and capacity building.
6. There is also a need to promote sustainable and inclusive agricultural practices, such as agroecology and organic farming, which can help to improve soil health, reduce pesticide use, and increase resilience to climate change.
7. Finally, there is a need to strengthen regional and international cooperation on agricultural issues, including through the African Union and other regional bodies, to promote trade and investment in the sector and to address common challenges such as climate change and food security.
