Roasting a pig at home for Thanksgiving can be a rewarding and delicious experience. Here are some equipment and techniques you'll need to successfully get a pig roasted:

1. A large roasting pan or a rotisserie: A large roasting pan with a rack will allow the pig to cook evenly and catch the juices. Alternatively, a rotisserie can be used to cook the pig, which will ensure even cooking and browning.

2. A meat thermometer: A meat thermometer is essential to ensure that the pig is cooked to the proper internal temperature. The recommended internal temperature for a roasted pig is 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare, 160°F (71°C) for medium, and 170°F (77°C) for well-done.

3. A basting brush: A basting brush will help you apply a flavorful marinade or sauce to the pig as it cooks.

4. A sharp knife: A sharp knife will make it easier to carve the pig once it's cooked.

5. A heat source: You'll need a heat source, such as a gas or charcoal grill, to cook the pig. Make sure the heat source is large enough to accommodate the size of the pig.

6. A marinade or rub: A marinade or rub can add flavor and moisture to the pig as it cooks. You can use a store-bought marinade or rub, or make your own using ingredients like garlic, herbs, and spices.

7. A roasting rack: A roasting rack will help the pig cook evenly and prevent it from sitting in its own juices.

8. A foil tent: A foil tent can be used to cover the pig during the last hour of cooking to help it retain moisture and prevent it from drying out.

9. A carving board: A carving board will make it easier to carve the pig once it's cooked.

10. A serving platter: A serving platter will make it easier to transport the pig to the table once it's cooked.

By following these tips and using the right equipment, you can successfully roast a pig at home for Thanksgiving. Enjoy!
