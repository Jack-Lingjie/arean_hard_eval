The Balfour Declaration is a public statement issued by the British government in 1917, during World War I. The declaration stated that the British government viewed "with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," and it became a significant milestone in the history of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel. The declaration was named after Arthur James Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary who signed it.
