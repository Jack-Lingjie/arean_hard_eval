Car manufacturers employ various methods to reduce emissions in their internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, in addition to optimizing fuel efficiency. Here are some of the main methods used:

1. **Engine technology:** Manufacturers are constantly developing and improving engine technologies to reduce emissions. For example, direct injection engines, which inject fuel directly into the combustion chamber, can improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Other technologies include variable valve timing, turbocharging, and cylinder deactivation.

2. **Aftertreatment systems:** Aftertreatment systems, such as catalytic converters and particulate filters, are used to reduce emissions from the exhaust gases. These systems convert harmful pollutants into less harmful substances before they are released into the atmosphere.

3. **Start-stop systems:** Start-stop systems automatically turn off the engine when the car is idling, such as at traffic lights or in stop-and-go traffic. This reduces fuel consumption and emissions, especially in urban areas.

4. **Hybrid and electric powertrains:** Hybrid and electric vehicles use a combination of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor to power the car. This allows for greater fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, as the electric motor can provide power when the engine is not needed.

5. **Regenerative braking:** Regenerative braking systems capture the energy generated during braking and store it in a battery or other energy storage system. This energy can then be used to power the car's electrical systems or to recharge the battery, reducing the need for the engine to generate power.

6. **Lightweight materials:** Using lightweight materials, such as aluminum and carbon fiber, can reduce the weight of the car and improve fuel efficiency. This can also reduce emissions, as a lighter car requires less energy to move.

7. **Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS):** ADAS technologies, such as adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning, can help drivers maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid accidents. This can reduce the need for sudden braking or acceleration, which can improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.

8. **Fuel economy standards:** Governments and regulatory bodies set fuel economy standards to encourage car manufacturers to develop more efficient vehicles. These standards can help reduce emissions and improve air quality.

In summary, car manufacturers use a combination of engine technology, aftertreatment systems, hybrid and electric powertrains, regenerative braking, lightweight materials, advanced driver assistance systems, and fuel economy standards to reduce emissions in their ICE cars. By implementing these methods, car manufacturers can help reduce the environmental impact of their vehicles and contribute to a more sustainable future.
