Hip hop was invented in the 1970s, with its origins traced back to the Bronx, New York City. The exact date of its invention is difficult to pinpoint, as it emerged from a combination of various cultural influences and artistic expressions. However, the genre's roots can be traced to the late 1960s and early 1970s, when DJs began mixing records and creating new sounds, and graffiti artists started decorating subway trains and buildings. The first hip hop song, "Rapper's Delight," was released in 1979 by the Sugarhill Gang, marking the official birth of the genre.
