Here are some steps to help you wrap a present neatly:

1. Choose a wrapping paper that complements the gift and the recipient's taste.
2. Lay the paper out flat on a table or other surface.
3. Place the gift in the center of the paper, making sure it is centered.
4. Fold the top corner of the paper over the gift, and then fold the bottom corner over the gift.
5. Tuck the sides of the paper under the gift, and then fold the remaining corners over the gift.
6. Use tape to secure the corners and sides of the paper to the gift.
7. Add a bow or other decoration to the top of the gift.
8. Enjoy your neatly wrapped present!
