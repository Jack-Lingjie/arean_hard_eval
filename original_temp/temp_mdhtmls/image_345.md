Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment proposed by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1935. The experiment illustrates the paradoxical nature of quantum mechanics, where a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is observed. In the case of Schrodinger's cat, a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive substance and a poison. According to quantum mechanics, the radioactive substance can decay or not decay, and the cat can be both alive and dead simultaneously until the box is opened and the state is observed. The experiment highlights the counterintuitive nature of quantum mechanics and the need for a more complete understanding of the behavior of particles at the subatomic level.
