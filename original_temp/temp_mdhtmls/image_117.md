Here are some suggestions to help keep your neighbour's cat out of your garden and prevent conflicts with your own cat:

1. Install a cat-proof fence: A tall, sturdy fence can help keep your neighbour's cat out of your garden. Make sure the fence is at least 6 feet tall and has a secure top to prevent the cat from climbing over.

2. Use motion-activated sprinklers: Motion-activated sprinklers can be a great deterrent for cats. When the cat enters the garden, the sprinkler will activate and spray water, which will startle the cat and discourage it from returning.

3. Plant cat-repellent plants: Certain plants, such as lavender, rosemary, and citronella, have strong scents that cats find unpleasant. Planting these in your garden can help keep your neighbour's cat away.

4. Use a motion-activated ultrasonic device: Motion-activated ultrasonic devices emit high-frequency sounds that are inaudible to humans but can be very irritating to cats. When the cat enters the garden, the device will activate and emit the sound, which will startle the cat and discourage it from returning.

5. Keep your cat indoors: If your cat is the one causing the conflict, keeping it indoors can help prevent fights with your neighbour's cat. Provide your cat with plenty of toys and playtime to keep it entertained and happy.

6. Talk to your neighbour: If all else fails, try talking to your neighbour about the issue. They may not be aware that their cat is causing a problem, and they may be willing to work with you to find a solution.

Remember, it's important to be patient and persistent when trying to keep your neighbour's cat out of your garden. With a little effort and creativity, you can find a solution that works for everyone.
