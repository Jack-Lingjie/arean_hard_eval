While labeling prompts on Open Assistant can be helpful in understanding the context of your project, it may not be the most efficient use of your time when you have a project due in 2 weeks. It's important to prioritize your tasks and focus on completing the project itself. Consider breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and allocating time for each one. Additionally, seek help from your teacher, classmates, or a tutor if you're struggling to make progress. Remember, it's better to start working on the project now rather than waiting until the last minute. Good luck!
