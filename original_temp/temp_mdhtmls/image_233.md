The construction of a pipeline, such as the Keystone XL pipeline, can be subject to government approval and regulation due to various reasons. Here are some possible explanations:

1. Environmental concerns: Pipelines can have significant environmental impacts, including potential oil spills, habitat destruction, and greenhouse gas emissions. Governments may require environmental impact assessments and permits to ensure that the pipeline is built in an environmentally responsible manner.

2. Public safety: Pipelines can pose risks to public safety, including the potential for explosions, fires, and leaks. Governments may require safety inspections and certifications to ensure that the pipeline is built and operated safely.

3. Landowner rights: Pipelines often require the use of private land, which can impact landowners' rights and property values. Governments may require negotiations and compensation for landowners affected by the pipeline.

4. National security: Pipelines can be critical infrastructure for the transportation of energy resources, and governments may require security measures to protect against potential threats, such as terrorism or sabotage.

5. Economic considerations: Pipelines can have significant economic impacts, including job creation, tax revenue, and economic development. Governments may require economic assessments and benefits to ensure that the pipeline is in the public interest.

In summary, the construction of a pipeline can be subject to government approval and regulation due to environmental, safety, landowner, national security, and economic considerations. While this may involve government interference with private corporations, it is often necessary to ensure that the pipeline is built in a responsible and sustainable manner.
