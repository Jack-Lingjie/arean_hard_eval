Based on current energy prices in Scotland, it is generally more cost-effective to heat your entire house using gas rather than using electric heaters to heat individual rooms. Gas is typically cheaper than electricity for heating purposes, and a central heating system with a gas boiler can provide efficient and even heat distribution throughout your home. However, if you have specific rooms that are not used frequently or require less heat, you could consider using electric heaters in those areas to save on energy costs. It's important to note that the cost-effectiveness of heating methods can vary depending on factors such as the size of your home, insulation, and local energy prices. To determine the most cost-effective heating solution for your specific situation, it may be helpful to consult a professional energy advisor or conduct a home energy audit.
