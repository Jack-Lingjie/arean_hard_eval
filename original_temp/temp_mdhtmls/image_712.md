Leg raises are a great exercise to strengthen your core muscles, including the abdominal muscles, lower back, and hip flexors. Here are the instructions for performing leg raises:

1. Lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides and your legs straight out in front of you.
2. Engage your core muscles by tightening your abdominal muscles and pressing your lower back into the floor.
3. Slowly lift your legs up towards the ceiling, keeping them straight and together. Make sure to keep your lower back pressed into the floor throughout the movement.
4. Hold the raised position for a few seconds, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, aiming for 10-15 reps per set.

Remember to breathe throughout the exercise, exhaling as you lift your legs and inhaling as you lower them back down. Start with a few sets of 10-15 reps and gradually increase the number of reps as you build strength.
