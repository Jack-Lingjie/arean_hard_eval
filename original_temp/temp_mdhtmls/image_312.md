Software Defined Radio (SDR) can be used to detect and locate a drone flying over your property, but it requires some technical expertise and specialized equipment. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Choose an SDR device: There are several SDR devices available in the market, such as RTL-SDR, HackRF, and USRP. Choose one that suits your needs and budget.

2. Install the necessary software: You will need to install software such as GQRX, SDR# or CubicSDR to receive and analyze the signals from the drone.

3. Set up the antenna: You will need to set up an antenna that can receive the signals from the drone. A directional antenna can help you narrow down the location of the drone.

4. Tune the frequency: Use the software to tune the frequency of the SDR device to the frequency used by the drone. You can use online resources or drone manuals to find out the frequency used by the drone.

5. Monitor the signals: Once you have tuned the frequency, start monitoring the signals. You may need to adjust the gain and other settings to optimize the signal reception.

6. Locate the drone: By analyzing the signals, you can determine the direction and distance of the drone. You can use a map or GPS to locate the drone.

7. Take action: Depending on your local laws and regulations, you may need to take action to stop the drone from flying over your property. You can contact the authorities or take other measures to ensure your safety and privacy.

It's important to note that using SDR to detect and locate drones requires technical expertise and specialized equipment. It's also important to follow local laws and regulations when dealing with drones.
