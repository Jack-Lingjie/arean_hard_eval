Pearls are formed when a foreign object, such as a grain of sand, enters an oyster or mollusk and irritates its soft tissue. In response, the mollusk secretes a substance called nacre, which coats the irritant and forms a lustrous, round object known as a pearl. Pearls are found in various types of mollusks, including oysters, mussels, and clams. The most common sources of pearls are saltwater oysters, which are found in the oceans and coastal waters of many countries, including Australia, Japan, and the Philippines. Freshwater pearls, on the other hand, are found in freshwater mussels, which are found in rivers, lakes, and streams in countries such as China, the United States, and Europe.
