If Christopher Columbus had not discovered the Americas, the world would have taken a different course. Here are some potential outcomes:

1. European exploration of the Americas would have been delayed: Without Columbus' voyages, European exploration of the Americas would have been delayed. This could have led to a slower spread of diseases, such as smallpox, which devastated indigenous populations.

2. Indigenous cultures would have remained more isolated: Without European contact, indigenous cultures in the Americas would have remained more isolated. This could have led to a greater diversity of languages, cultures, and traditions.

3. European colonization of the Americas would have been different: Without Columbus' voyages, European colonization of the Americas would have taken a different form. For example, Spain might have focused more on trade with the indigenous peoples rather than conquest.

4. The slave trade would have been different: Without Columbus' voyages, the slave trade would have taken a different form. For example, African slaves might have been brought to the Americas through different routes.

5. The world would have been different: Without Columbus' voyages, the world would have been different. For example, the United States might not have been founded, and the world might not have been divided into the Western and Eastern hemispheres.

Overall, it is impossible to know exactly how the world would have been different if Columbus had not discovered the Americas. However, it is clear that his voyages had a profound impact on the world, and that the world would have taken a different course without them.
