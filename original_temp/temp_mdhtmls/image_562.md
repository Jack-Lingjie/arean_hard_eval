In Java, the == operator checks for reference equality, while the .equals() method checks for value equality. When comparing strings, it is recommended to use the .equals() method, as it takes into account the actual content of the strings, whereas the == operator only checks if they refer to the same object in memory. The == operator should not be used to compare strings, as it may lead to unexpected results.
