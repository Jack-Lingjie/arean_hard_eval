Some people enjoy the sensation of being scared because it releases adrenaline and endorphins, which can create a sense of excitement and euphoria. This is known as the "adrenaline rush" or "rush of excitement." For others, the fear of being scared can be overwhelming and cause anxiety or distress. This is known as the "fight or flight" response, which is a natural reaction to perceived danger.
