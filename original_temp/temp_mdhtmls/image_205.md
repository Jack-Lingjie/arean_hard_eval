As a therapist, I would suggest the following steps to help you become less reactive and use a pause ritual:

1. **Recognize your triggers:** Take some time to reflect on what situations, people, or thoughts tend to trigger your reactive behavior. This could be anything from a specific word or tone of voice to a particular topic of conversation. By identifying your triggers, you can begin to anticipate them and prepare yourself for a more calm and composed response.

2. **Practice mindfulness:** Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment and fully aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. By practicing mindfulness, you can learn to observe your reactions without judgment and choose a more appropriate response. Try setting aside a few minutes each day to focus on your breath and notice any thoughts or emotions that arise without getting caught up in them.

3. **Use a pause ritual:** A pause ritual is a simple yet effective way to give yourself a moment to collect your thoughts and choose a more thoughtful response. Here's a suggested pause ritual:

- Take a deep breath and count to three.
- Close your eyes and imagine a calming scene, such as a peaceful beach or a serene forest.
- Repeat a mantra or affirmation to yourself, such as "I am calm and in control" or "I choose to respond rather than react."
- Open your eyes and take a moment to assess the situation before responding.

4. **Practice self-compassion:** Reactivity often stems from a lack of self-compassion. When we are kind and understanding towards ourselves, we are more likely to respond to situations with empathy and understanding. Try practicing self-compassion by speaking to yourself in a gentle and supportive way, acknowledging your feelings without judgment, and offering yourself the same care and understanding you would offer to a friend.

5. **Seek support:** If you find it difficult to implement these strategies on your own, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can provide guidance and support as you work to develop more effective coping skills and respond to situations in a more thoughtful and compassionate way.

Remember, becoming less reactive takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate your progress along the way.
