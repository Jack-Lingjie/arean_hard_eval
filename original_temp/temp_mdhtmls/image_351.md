The KeyHole series of spy satellites, also known as KH satellites, were indeed developed and operated by the US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) from the 1960s to the 2000s. These satellites were designed to provide high-resolution imagery of the Earth's surface, primarily for military and intelligence purposes. They were indeed similar in capabilities to the Hubble Space Telescope, but their primary focus was on Earth observation rather than astronomical research.

The KeyHole series was divided into several generations, each with its own unique capabilities and characteristics. The first generation, known as KH-1, was launched in 1960 and consisted of a single satellite equipped with a film camera. The second generation, KH-2, was launched in 1962 and featured a more advanced film camera with improved resolution. The third generation, KH-3, was launched in 1964 and introduced the first electronic imaging system, which allowed for real-time image transmission.

The fourth generation, KH-4, was launched in 1965 and featured a more advanced electronic imaging system with improved resolution. The fifth generation, KH-5, was launched in 1966 and consisted of a series of satellites equipped with a panoramic camera that could capture images of large areas of the Earth's surface. The sixth generation, KH-6, was launched in 1967 and featured a more advanced electronic imaging system with even higher resolution.

The seventh generation, KH-7, was launched in 1968 and consisted of a series of satellites equipped with a high-resolution camera that could capture images of small areas of the Earth's surface. The eighth generation, KH-8, was launched in 1971 and featured a more advanced electronic imaging system with even higher resolution.

The ninth generation, KH-9, was launched in 1971 and consisted of a series of satellites equipped with a high-resolution camera that could capture images of large areas of the Earth's surface. The tenth generation, KH-10, was launched in 1972 and featured a more advanced electronic imaging system with even higher resolution.

The eleventh generation, KH-11, was launched in 1976 and consisted of a series of satellites equipped with a high-resolution camera that could capture images of small areas of the Earth's surface. The twelfth generation, KH-12, was launched in 1995 and featured a more advanced electronic imaging system with even higher resolution.

The KeyHole series of spy satellites were retired in the early 2000s, but their capabilities and technology have had a significant impact on the development of modern satellite imaging systems. Today, many commercial satellite imaging companies, such as DigitalGlobe and Planet Labs, use similar technology to provide high-resolution imagery of the Earth's surface for a variety of applications, including environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban planning.
