Turkeys became the official food of Thanksgiving because they were abundant in the New England region during the fall season, making them a practical choice for the first Thanksgiving feast in 1621. Additionally, turkeys were a familiar food to the English settlers, who had eaten them in England. The tradition of serving turkey at Thanksgiving has continued ever since, becoming a symbol of the holiday and a staple on many American tables.
