Here are some subtle clues that suggest someone is pretending to understand a topic or conversation when they are actually confused or uninformed:

1. Repetition: If someone frequently repeats the same question or asks for clarification on the same point, it may indicate that they are struggling to understand the topic.

2. Lack of engagement: If someone appears disinterested or unengaged in the conversation, it may suggest that they are not fully grasping the topic.

3. Use of vague language: If someone uses vague language or avoids specific details, it may indicate that they are not fully informed about the topic.

4. Lack of follow-up questions: If someone does not ask follow-up questions or seek clarification, it may suggest that they are not fully understanding the conversation.

5. Inconsistent responses: If someone gives inconsistent responses or contradicts themselves, it may indicate that they are not fully grasping the topic.

6. Lack of context: If someone does not provide context or background information, it may suggest that they are not fully informed about the topic.

7. Use of jargon: If someone uses technical jargon or industry-specific terms without explanation, it may indicate that they are not fully informed about the topic.

8. Lack of participation: If someone does not participate in the conversation or contribute their own thoughts and ideas, it may suggest that they are not fully understanding the topic.

9. Lack of eye contact: If someone avoids eye contact or looks away frequently, it may indicate that they are not fully engaged in the conversation.

10. Lack of body language: If someone does not use appropriate body language, such as nodding or smiling, it may suggest that they are not fully understanding the conversation.

It's important to remember that these clues are not definitive and should be used in conjunction with other cues to determine someone's level of understanding. Additionally, it's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, as it may be that the person is simply struggling to understand the topic.
