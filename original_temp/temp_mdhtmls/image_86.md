Of course! Here are the steps to refill your grandfather's antique fountain pen:

1. Unscrew the cap from the pen and remove the nib and feed. Set them aside in a safe place.

2. Remove the ink cartridge from the bottle of ink. If your fountain pen does not have an ink cartridge, you can use a syringe or eyedropper to fill the pen directly.

3. If using a syringe or eyedropper, insert the tip into the pen's reservoir and slowly squeeze the ink into the pen. Be careful not to overfill the pen, as this can cause ink to leak out of the nib.

4. If using an ink cartridge, insert the cartridge into the pen's reservoir and screw the cap back on tightly.

5. Reattach the nib and feed to the pen and screw the cap back on tightly.

6. Test the pen by writing a few words on a piece of paper. If the ink flows smoothly and evenly, your pen is ready to use!

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
