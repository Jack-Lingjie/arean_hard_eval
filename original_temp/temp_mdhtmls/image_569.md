The given problem is to retrieve the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead. The implementation provided uses a left join to achieve this result. A left join returns all rows from the left table (Person) and the matched rows from the right table (Address). If there is no match, the right table columns will have null values. In this case, the columns from the Address table will have null values if there is no matching row in the Address table for a given PersonId. The query selects the desired columns from both tables and returns the result in any order.
