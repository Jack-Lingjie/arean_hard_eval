The reason you can't see the stars in the city is due to light pollution. In urban areas, there are many sources of artificial light, such as streetlights, buildings, and vehicles, which can make it difficult to see the stars. In contrast, in rural areas, there is less artificial light, allowing the stars to be more visible. Additionally, the atmosphere in cities is often more polluted, which can also affect the visibility of stars.
