Certainly! I am happy to assist you in looking after the three active boys aged 4-8 during the evening hours. I will ensure their safety, provide engaging activities, and be available to assist with any needs they may have. I will also be mindful of their age differences and tailor my approach accordingly. Let me know if there is anything specific you would like me to focus on or if you have any other requests.
