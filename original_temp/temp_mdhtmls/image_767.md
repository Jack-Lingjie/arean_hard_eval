There are approximately 45 lightning strikes occurring on Earth every second, which translates to around 1.4 million lightning strikes per day. This number is based on data collected by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Here's a step-by-step explanation of how we arrive at this figure:

1. Lightning is a natural phenomenon that occurs when there is a buildup of static electricity in the atmosphere. This can happen when warm, moist air rises and cools, creating clouds. As the air cools, water droplets and ice crystals form, and the resulting electrical charges can build up within the cloud.

2. When the electrical charges become too great, they discharge through the air in the form of lightning. This process can occur within a single cloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground.

3. To estimate the number of lightning strikes occurring on Earth each day, we can use data from lightning detection networks. These networks use a variety of sensors, such as lightning location systems (LLS) and very low frequency (VLF) receivers, to detect and locate lightning strikes.

4. The WMO and NOAA maintain global lightning detection networks that collect data from sensors around the world. These networks provide real-time information on the location, intensity, and frequency of lightning strikes.

5. By analyzing this data, scientists can estimate the number of lightning strikes occurring on Earth each day. According to the WMO, there are approximately 16 million lightning strikes per year, which translates to around 45 strikes per second.

6. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on data from a limited number of sensors, and may not be representative of lightning activity in all regions of the world. Additionally, the number of lightning strikes can vary significantly depending on factors such as weather patterns, topography, and human activity.

In conclusion, there are approximately 45 lightning strikes occurring on Earth every second, which translates to around 1.4 million lightning strikes per day. This estimate is based on data from global lightning detection networks, but may not be representative of lightning activity in all regions of the world.
