If the Aztecs had successfully repelled the Spanish conquistadors, it is likely that the course of history in the Americas would have been significantly different. The Aztec Empire would have continued to flourish and expand, and the Spanish colonization of the Americas would have been delayed or prevented altogether. This could have resulted in a very different political, cultural, and economic landscape in the Americas, with the Aztecs playing a much larger role in shaping the region's history. It is impossible to predict exactly how things would have unfolded, but it is clear that the outcome would have been far-reaching and significant.
