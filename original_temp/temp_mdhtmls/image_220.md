Yo, let me break it down for y'all, so you don't get caught in a bind
When it comes to war, there's a line that you can't cross, it's a crime
So, here's the deal, don't engage in any acts that cause harm to civilians
Respect their rights, their homes, their lives, it's the right thing to do
Don't use weapons that cause unnecessary suffering, like chemical or biological weapons
They're not just weapons, they're weapons of mass destruction, so don't even think about using them
And when it comes to targeting, make sure you're hitting the right target
Don't cause collateral damage, it's not worth the risk, it's not worth the hurt
So, be precise, be careful, and make sure you're not causing any harm
And when it comes to the rules of war, make sure you're following them
Don't use children as soldiers, don't target hospitals or schools, it's just not right
And when it comes to the Geneva Conventions, make sure you're abiding by them
Don't torture prisoners, don't use them as human shields, it's just not right
So, in conclusion, when it comes to war, be smart, be careful, and be respectful
Don't commit any war crimes, it's not worth the risk, it's not worth the hurt.
