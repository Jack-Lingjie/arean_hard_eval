To cook a salmon fillet on a stove top pan, follow these steps:

1. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add a small amount of oil or butter to the pan, just enough to coat the bottom.

2. Season the salmon fillet with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings. You can also add a squeeze of lemon juice or a drizzle of olive oil for extra flavor.

3. Place the salmon fillet skin-side down in the hot pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the skin is crispy and the fish is starting to turn opaque.

4. Carefully flip the salmon fillet over using a spatula. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.

5. Remove the salmon from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your delicious, stove-top cooked salmon fillet!

Note: The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the salmon fillet and the heat of your stove. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the salmon reaches 145°F (63°C) for safe consumption.
