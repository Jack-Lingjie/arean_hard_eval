The American version of "The Office" may not have resonated with you due to its departure from the original British series. The American adaptation, while still featuring a similar premise, often deviated from the original's tone, humor, and character development. This divergence could have led to a disconnect between your expectations and the show's execution, resulting in a lack of enjoyment. Additionally, cultural differences and the Americanization of the characters and situations may have contributed to your dislike. When discussing your opinion, you can emphasize the unique qualities of the British version that you prefer, such as its dry humor, character depth, and more subtle storytelling.
