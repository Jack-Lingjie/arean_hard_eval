TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. This can lead to more robust and maintainable code. TypeScript also provides features such as interfaces, classes, and modules, which make it easier to organize and structure large-scale applications.

Duck Typing is a concept in object-oriented programming that states that if an object looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck. In other words, if an object has the same properties and methods as another object, it can be treated as if it were that object. Duck Typing is often used in dynamic languages like Python and Ruby, where the type of an object is not explicitly declared. Instead, the type is inferred based on the object's behavior. This can make code more flexible and easier to write, but it can also make it harder to catch errors at compile time.
