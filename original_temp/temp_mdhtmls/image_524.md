Here are a few papers that address the topic of scaling laws and machine learning:

1. "Deep Learning Scaling is Predictable, Empirically" by Goyal et al. (2017)
2. "Universal Laws of Learning" by Bengio et al. (2019)
3. "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models" by Kaplan et al. (2020)
4. "Scaling Laws for Neural Machine Translation" by Ott et al. (2018)
5. "Scaling Laws for Transfer Learning" by Chen et al. (2020)

These papers provide insights into the relationship between scaling laws and machine learning, and offer predictions and empirical evidence to support their claims.
