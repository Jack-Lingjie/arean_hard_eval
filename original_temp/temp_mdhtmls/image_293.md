 Technology is not everything that doesn't work yet. Technology is a constantly evolving field that encompasses a wide range of tools, systems, and processes designed to improve our lives and make our world a better place. While it is true that some technologies may not yet be fully developed or perfected, many others have already proven to be highly effective and beneficial. In fact, technology has played a crucial role in advancing human civilization and improving the quality of life for billions of people around the world. From medical breakthroughs to communication advancements, technology has the potential to solve some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. Therefore, it is inaccurate and misleading to suggest that technology is nothing more than a collection of failed experiments.
