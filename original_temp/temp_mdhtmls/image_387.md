The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight interacts with the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, causing the shorter, bluer wavelengths of light to scatter more than the longer, redder wavelengths. As a result, the blue light is scattered in all directions, reaching our eyes and making the sky appear blue. The longer wavelengths of light, such as red and orange, are less affected by scattering and tend to pass through the atmosphere, giving the sun and clouds their characteristic reddish hues at sunrise and sunset.
