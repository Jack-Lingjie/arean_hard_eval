The method used in the research is an end-to-end deep learning approach for speech recognition. The key aspects of the method include: a simplified architecture that does not rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines, direct learning of a function that is robust to background noise, reverberation, and speaker variation, and the use of multiple GPUs and novel data synthesis techniques for efficient training.
