A Dyson Sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that could be built around a star to capture its energy output. The concept was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960. The idea is that a civilization could construct a series of orbiting rings or shells that would enclose a star and collect its energy. The energy could then be used to power the civilization's technology and support its population. Dyson Spheres are often depicted as giant, spherical structures, but they could take many different forms depending on the technology and materials available to the civilization that builds them. While Dyson Spheres are purely hypothetical, they have inspired many works of science fiction and continue to be a subject of interest among scientists and engineers.
