In the context of turn-based strategy games like Into the Breach, "perfect information" refers to the fact that all players have complete knowledge of the game state at all times. This means that every player can see the entire game board, including the positions of all units, the terrain, and any other relevant information. In contrast, games with imperfect information may have hidden information, such as cards in a deck or units that are not visible to all players. In these games, players must make decisions based on the information they have, which can lead to uncertainty and strategic complexity.
