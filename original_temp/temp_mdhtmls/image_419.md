JavaScript is a front-end language. It is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning it runs in the user's web browser and interacts with the user interface. JavaScript is commonly used to add interactivity, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and handle user events in web applications. However, it can also be used for server-side scripting through frameworks like Node.js, making it a versatile language for both front-end and back-end development.
