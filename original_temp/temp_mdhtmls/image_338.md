Here are some suggestions for cheering up a friend who had a bad day without making it too obvious and helping them keep their mind off things:

1. Listen actively: Show your friend that you care by actively listening to them and validating their feelings. Let them know that you are there for them and that you understand what they are going through.

2. Offer a distraction: Suggest a fun activity that will take their mind off their bad day, such as going for a walk, watching a movie, or playing a game. This can help them relax and forget about their troubles for a while.

3. Provide comfort: Offer a hug or a shoulder to cry on if your friend needs it. Physical touch can be a powerful way to show support and comfort.

4. Encourage self-care: Remind your friend to take care of themselves, whether that means getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals, or taking a break from their worries. Self-care can help them feel more in control and less overwhelmed.

5. Offer practical help: If your friend is struggling with a specific problem, offer to help them with practical tasks, such as running errands or doing chores. This can take some of the burden off their shoulders and make them feel more supported.

6. Be positive: Try to focus on the positive aspects of the situation and offer words of encouragement. This can help your friend see the silver lining and feel more hopeful about the future.

7. Avoid judgment: It's important to avoid passing judgment on your friend's situation or offering unsolicited advice. Instead, focus on being a supportive listener and offering practical help when needed.

8. Follow up: Check in with your friend regularly to see how they are doing and offer additional support if needed. This can help them feel less alone and more connected to their support system.

Remember, everyone deals with difficult situations differently, so it's important to be flexible and adaptable in your approach. The most important thing is to show your friend that you care and are there for them, no matter what.
