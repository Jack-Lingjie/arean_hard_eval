The phrase "If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to want a glass of milk" is a popular saying that comes from the children's book "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie" by Laura Numeroff. The book is about a mouse who asks for a cookie, and then wants more and more things, leading to a chain reaction of events. The idea behind the phrase is that if you give someone something, they may want more and more, and it can lead to a never-ending cycle of requests. This can be a problem in real life, as it can lead to people feeling entitled to more and more things, and it can be difficult to say no to their requests.
