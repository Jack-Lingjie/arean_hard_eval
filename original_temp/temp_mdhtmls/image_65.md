Making bubble solution is a fun and easy activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Here's a simple recipe for making bubble solution:

Ingredients:

* 1 cup of water
* 1/2 cup of dish soap (such as Dawn or Joy)
* 1/4 cup of glycerin (optional, but recommended for stronger bubbles)

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, mix together the water, dish soap, and glycerin (if using). Stir until the soap is fully dissolved.

2. Pour the bubble solution into a clean, empty 2-liter soda bottle. You can also use a pitcher or any other container with a spout.

3. Add a few drops of food coloring (optional) to the bubble solution to make colorful bubbles.

4. Shake the bottle vigorously for about 30 seconds to mix the ingredients and create a frothy solution.

5. Dip a bubble wand or straw into the bubble solution and blow gently to create bubbles.

6. Enjoy watching the bubbles float and pop!

Note: If the bubbles are not forming properly, try adding more dish soap or glycerin to the solution. You can also try using a different type of dish soap or adding a few drops of vinegar to the solution to help stabilize the bubbles.
