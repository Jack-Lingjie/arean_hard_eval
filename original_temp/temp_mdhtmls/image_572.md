The "fair trade" movement, also known as the "trade justice" movement, is a global initiative that aims to promote the use of labor, environmental, and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. This movement advocates for fair wages, safe working conditions, and sustainable practices in the production of goods, with the ultimate goal of improving the livelihoods of marginalized producers and workers. The fair trade movement has also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right, as it seeks to address the imbalances and injustices that exist in the global trade system. By promoting fair trade practices, the movement aims to create a more equitable and sustainable global economy that benefits all stakeholders, including producers, workers, consumers, and the environment.
