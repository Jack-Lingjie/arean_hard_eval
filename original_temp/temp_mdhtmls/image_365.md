To normalize a vector, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the magnitude of the vector using the formula: magnitude = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), where x, y, and z are the components of the vector.

2. Divide each component of the vector by the magnitude to obtain the normalized vector. The formula for normalization is: normalized_vector = (x/magnitude, y/magnitude, z/magnitude).

3. The resulting normalized vector will have a magnitude of 1, and its direction will be the same as the original vector.

For example, let's normalize the vector (3, 4, 5):

1. Calculate the magnitude: magnitude = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(36 + 16 + 25) = sqrt(77) ≈ 8.77

2. Normalize the vector: normalized_vector = (3/8.77, 4/8.77, 5/8.77) ≈ (0.34, 0.46, 0.57)

3. The normalized vector has a magnitude of 1: sqrt(0.34^2 + 0.46^2 + 0.57^2) ≈ 1.00
