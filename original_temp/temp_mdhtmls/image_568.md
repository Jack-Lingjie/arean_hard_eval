You can handle this situation by actively listening to your interviewer's suggestion while also keeping your focus on your original solution. Here are some tips to help you navigate this situation:

1. Stay calm and composed: It's natural to feel nervous or anxious during a coding interview, but try to stay calm and composed. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that you can handle this situation.

2. Listen actively: Pay close attention to your interviewer's suggestion and try to understand their perspective. Ask clarifying questions if necessary to ensure you fully understand their suggestion.

3. Keep your focus: While you're listening to your interviewer's suggestion, try to keep your focus on your original solution. This will help you stay on track and avoid getting sidetracked by the new suggestion.

4. Evaluate the new suggestion: Once you've fully understood your interviewer's suggestion, take some time to evaluate it. Consider whether it's a better approach than your original solution, and whether it would be feasible to implement.

5. Communicate your thoughts: Once you've evaluated the new suggestion, communicate your thoughts to your interviewer. Let them know whether you think it's a better approach, and if so, why. If not, explain why you prefer your original solution.

By following these tips, you can navigate this situation with confidence and demonstrate your ability to think on your feet. Good luck!
