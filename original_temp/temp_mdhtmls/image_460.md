In reStructuredText (RST), you can format URLs by enclosing them in angle brackets (< >) or double angle brackets (<< >>). Here are some examples:

* <https://www.example.com>
* <<https://www.example.com>>
* <https://www.example.com/path/to/resource>
* <<https://www.example.com/path/to/resource>>

Note that the URL should be wrapped in spaces or line breaks to avoid being interpreted as a link.
