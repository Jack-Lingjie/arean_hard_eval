If Vincent van Gogh had been a successful artist during his lifetime, it is likely that he would have received more recognition and appreciation for his work. He may have been able to sell more paintings, which could have provided him with financial stability and allowed him to continue creating art without the constant worry of money. Additionally, he may have been able to travel more and meet other artists, which could have expanded his artistic horizons and influenced his work. However, it is important to note that success is subjective and can be measured in different ways, so it is difficult to say exactly how van Gogh's life and art would have been different if he had been more successful during his lifetime.
