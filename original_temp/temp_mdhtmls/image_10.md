Yes, retinoids can be effective in treating acne. Retinoids are a type of vitamin A derivative that help to unclog pores, reduce inflammation, and promote cell turnover, which can all contribute to clearer skin. However, it's important to note that results may vary depending on the individual and the severity of their acne. It's always a good idea to consult with a dermatologist before starting any new skincare regimen, especially if you have sensitive skin or are using other acne treatments.
