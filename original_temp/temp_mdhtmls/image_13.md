For beginners, the best exercises are those that focus on building a strong foundation and improving overall fitness. Here are some exercises that are suitable for beginners:

1. Walking or Jogging: Start with a brisk walk or light jog for 20-30 minutes, gradually increasing the duration and intensity as you become more comfortable.

2. Bodyweight Exercises: Squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks are great for building strength and improving balance. Start with a few repetitions and gradually increase the number of sets and reps as you become more comfortable.

3. Yoga or Pilates: These low-impact exercises can help improve flexibility, balance, and core strength. Start with beginner-level classes or follow along with online tutorials.

4. Swimming: Swimming is a great full-body workout that is easy on the joints. Start with a few laps in the pool and gradually increase the distance and intensity.

5. Cycling: Cycling is a low-impact exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health and build leg strength. Start with a leisurely ride and gradually increase the distance and intensity.

Remember to always start with a warm-up, listen to your body, and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program.
