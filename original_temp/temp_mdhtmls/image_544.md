Oblique is a word that has its origins in the Latin word "obliquus," which means "slanting" or "inclined." The word was first used in the 16th century to describe something that was not straight or perpendicular, but rather at an angle. Over time, the word has come to be used in a variety of contexts, including in mathematics, geometry, and architecture. In mathematics, for example, an oblique line is one that is not parallel to the x-axis or y-axis, while in geometry, an oblique angle is one that is not a right angle. In architecture, an oblique building is one that is not symmetrical or straight, but rather has a slanted or angled appearance. Today, the word oblique is still used in a variety of contexts, and it continues to be a useful term for describing things that are not straight or perpendicular.
