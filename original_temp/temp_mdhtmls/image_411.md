Hi! Based on the information you provided, it is possible that your cat chewed on hairy bittercress (Cardamine hirsuta). While this plant is not considered toxic to cats, it can cause gastrointestinal upset if ingested in large quantities. It is always a good idea to keep your cat away from plants that are not safe for them to consume. If you are concerned about your cat's health, it is best to consult with a veterinarian.
