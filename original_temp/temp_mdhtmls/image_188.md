Based on the provided information, here are some recommendations for the 63-year-old male with diabetes and CKD:

1. Medication: The current medication regimen appears appropriate for managing diabetes and CKD. However, it is essential to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and kidney function regularly to ensure the medications are working effectively. If the patient's blood sugar levels are not well-controlled, switching to insulin may be necessary. Consult with the patient's healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.

2. Exercise and diet: Regular exercise and a healthy diet can help manage diabetes and slow the progression of CKD. The patient should aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week and follow a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. The patient should also limit their intake of sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars.

3. Additional exams: The patient should undergo regular kidney function tests, including blood tests and urine tests, to monitor their kidney health. The patient should also have their blood pressure checked regularly and follow their healthcare provider's recommendations for managing high blood pressure.

4. Avoid or delay dialysis: The patient should work closely with their healthcare provider to manage their diabetes and CKD to avoid or delay the need for dialysis. This may involve making lifestyle changes, such as exercising regularly and following a healthy diet, as well as taking medications as prescribed.

5. Skin itching: The patient's skin itching may be due to dry skin or a reaction to medications. The patient should use a moisturizer regularly and avoid harsh soaps and detergents. If the itching persists, the patient should consult with their healthcare provider.

6. Constipation: The patient's constipation may be due to a lack of fiber in their diet or a side effect of medications. The patient should increase their fiber intake by eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The patient should also drink plenty of water and exercise regularly to help prevent constipation.

In summary, the patient should work closely with their healthcare provider to manage their diabetes and CKD to avoid or delay the need for dialysis. Regular exercise and a healthy diet can help manage diabetes and slow the progression of CKD. The patient should also undergo regular kidney function tests and follow their healthcare provider's recommendations for managing high blood pressure.
