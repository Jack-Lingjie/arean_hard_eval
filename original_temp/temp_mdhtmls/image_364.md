The Trolley Problem is a thought experiment that presents a moral dilemma, and there is no universally agreed-upon, most ethical response. Some argue that the most ethical response is to prioritize the greater good and sacrifice the life of one person to save the lives of five. Others argue that it is unethical to directly cause the death of one person, even if it means saving the lives of others. Ultimately, the decision depends on one's personal values and beliefs.
