Vaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a disease-causing microorganism into the body, stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against that specific pathogen. These antibodies then provide long-lasting protection against future infections by the same microorganism. This process is known as active immunization. Vaccines can also contain components of the pathogen, such as proteins or DNA, which trigger the immune system to produce antibodies without exposing the individual to the actual microorganism. This is called passive immunization.

Herd immunity, also known as community immunity, occurs when a large portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection. This creates a protective barrier against the spread of the disease, as the virus or bacteria has fewer susceptible individuals to infect. As a result, the overall risk of infection and disease transmission is reduced, even for those who are not vaccinated or have not developed immunity. Herd immunity is an important public health strategy for controlling and eliminating infectious diseases.
