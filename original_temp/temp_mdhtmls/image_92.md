Hello! Here's a simple recipe for challah bread that you can try:

Ingredients:
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 packages active dry yeast (or 4 1/2 teaspoons)
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 1/2 cup warm milk
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 4 eggs, beaten
- 1 tablespoon poppy seeds (optional)

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Mix well.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together warm water, warm milk, oil, and 2 eggs. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until well combined.
3. Gradually add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough is no longer sticky. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.
5. Punch down the dough and divide it into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 12 inches long. Braid the ropes together, pinching the ends to seal.
6. Place the braided loaf on a greased baking sheet and let it rise for another 30 minutes.
7. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
8. Brush the top of the challah with the remaining egg, and sprinkle with poppy seeds if desired.
9. Bake the challah for 25-30 minutes, or until it is golden brown.
10. Remove the challah from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.

Enjoy your homemade challah!
