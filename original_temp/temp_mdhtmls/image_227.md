Dear Manager,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and kindly request your feedback on the dashboard I recently sent for your use. I am eager to learn how I can improve the dashboard to better meet your needs and expectations.

In addition, I would like to ask if it would be appropriate to share this dashboard with the team. If so, I would appreciate any guidance on the best way to present it, including any specific orientation or emphasis you would like me to highlight.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
