There are several reasons why someone might choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead of relying on a GPS device or smartphone app. Some of these reasons include:

1. Limited access to technology: In areas with limited access to technology, such as rural or remote locations, a paper map may be the only option for navigation. Additionally, some older vehicles may not have GPS capabilities, making a paper map a necessary tool for navigation.

2. Battery life: GPS devices and smartphone apps require a constant power source, such as a battery or charging cable. If the battery dies or the device runs out of power, the user may be left without a way to navigate. A paper map, on the other hand, does not require a power source and can be used indefinitely.

3. Offline access: GPS devices and smartphone apps require an internet connection to function, which may not always be available. A paper map, however, can be used offline and does not require an internet connection.

4. Personal preference: Some people may simply prefer the tactile experience of using a paper map, or may find it more reliable than a GPS device or smartphone app. Additionally, some people may not trust the accuracy of GPS devices or smartphone apps, and may prefer to rely on a paper map instead.

5. Emergency situations: In emergency situations, such as a power outage or a natural disaster, a paper map may be the only option for navigation. GPS devices and smartphone apps may not function in these situations, making a paper map a necessary tool for survival.

Overall, there are several reasons why someone might choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead of relying on a GPS device or smartphone app. While GPS devices and smartphone apps have many advantages, a paper map can be a reliable and useful tool in certain situations.
