Metals emit light in the form of thermal radiation, which is a combination of electromagnetic waves with different wavelengths. The wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on their temperature. As the temperature of a metal increases, the wavelengths of light emitted by it shift towards shorter wavelengths, and the intensity of the emitted light increases. This phenomenon is known as blackbody radiation, and it is described by Planck's law of blackbody radiation. The wavelengths of light emitted by metals at different temperatures can be calculated using Planck's law, which states that the spectral radiance of a blackbody at a given wavelength and temperature is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature and inversely proportional to the wavelength to the power of 5.
