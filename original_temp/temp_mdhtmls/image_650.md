Here are some helpful activities and conversation starters to use at meetups to break the ice:

1. **Icebreaker games:** Play a fun icebreaker game like Two Truths and a Lie, Would You Rather, or 20 Questions. These games help people get to know each other in a lighthearted and engaging way.

2. **Share a fun fact:** Ask everyone to share a fun fact about themselves. This can be anything from a hobby they enjoy to a unique talent they have. This helps people learn something new about each other and can spark interesting conversations.

3. **Ask open-ended questions:** Instead of asking closed-ended questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," ask open-ended questions that require more thought and discussion. For example, instead of asking "Do you like dogs?" ask "What's your favorite breed of dog and why?"

4. **Share a personal story:** Encourage people to share a personal story that relates to the topic of the meetup. This can help people connect on a deeper level and can lead to meaningful conversations.

5. **Ask for opinions:** Ask people for their opinions on a particular topic or issue. This can help people feel heard and can lead to interesting discussions.

6. **Share a joke:** Share a funny joke or meme to lighten the mood and get people laughing. This can help people relax and feel more comfortable in the group.

7. **Ask for advice:** Ask people for advice on a particular topic or issue. This can help people feel valued and can lead to helpful conversations.

8. **Share a hobby:** Share a hobby or interest that you have and ask others if they have any similar interests. This can help people find common ground and can lead to new friendships.

9. **Ask for feedback:** Ask people for feedback on a particular project or idea. This can help people feel valued and can lead to constructive conversations.

10. **Share a quote:** Share a quote that resonates with you and ask others if they have any similar quotes. This can help people connect on a deeper level and can lead to meaningful conversations.

Remember, the key to breaking the ice at a meetup is to be open, friendly, and willing to engage with others. By using these activities and conversation starters, you can help create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone to enjoy.
