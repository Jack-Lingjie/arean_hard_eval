Kobe beef is expensive due to several factors, including its rarity, the strict production standards, and the high demand for the premium quality meat. The cattle used for Kobe beef are raised in a specific region of Japan, and the production process involves a strict grading system, which ensures that only the highest quality meat is labeled as Kobe beef. Additionally, the limited supply and high demand for Kobe beef contribute to its high price.
