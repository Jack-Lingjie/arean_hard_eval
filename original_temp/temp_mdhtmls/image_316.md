Fermat's Last Theorem, also known as Wiles' Theorem, is a famous mathematical conjecture proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1637. It states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2. In other words, it is impossible to find non-zero integer solutions to the equation xn + yn = zn when n is greater than 2. This theorem remained unsolved for over 350 years until it was finally proven by Andrew Wiles in 1995.
