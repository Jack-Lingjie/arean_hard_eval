One effective mental exercise to manage anxiety is the 3-3-3 rule. This technique involves focusing on the present moment and grounding oneself in the here and now. Here's how it works:

1. Look around: Take a moment to look around and identify three things you can see. This helps to shift your focus away from anxious thoughts and bring your attention to the present environment.

2. Listen: Next, listen to three sounds you can hear. This can be anything from the sound of traffic outside, to the ticking of a clock, or the rustling of leaves. Paying attention to sounds helps to ground you in the present moment and can be a helpful distraction from anxious thoughts.

3. Feel: Finally, identify three things you can feel. This could be the sensation of your feet on the floor, the weight of your clothing, or the temperature of the air. Focusing on physical sensations can help to bring you back to the present moment and reduce anxiety.

By practicing the 3-3-3 rule regularly, you can train your mind to focus on the present moment and reduce anxiety. This technique is simple, easy to remember, and can be done anywhere, making it a great tool for managing anxiety on the go.
