 Hi! I'm happy to help you with that. Here's a simple recipe for making tahini at home:

Ingredients:
- 1 cup raw sesame seeds
- 1/4 cup olive oil (or other neutral oil)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Spread the sesame seeds in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown. Be careful not to burn them.
3. Let the sesame seeds cool completely.
4. In a food processor or blender, combine the toasted sesame seeds, olive oil, and salt. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed.
5. Taste the tahini and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
6. Transfer the tahini to a jar or container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Enjoy your homemade tahini with your falafel!
