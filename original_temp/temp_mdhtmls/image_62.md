Serial killers in the 70s and 80s were able to evade detection and continue their crimes for extended periods due to several factors. These include:

1. Lack of advanced forensic technology: In the 70s and 80s, forensic science was not as advanced as it is today. This made it more difficult to link crimes together and identify patterns, allowing serial killers to operate undetected for longer periods.

2. Limited communication and information sharing: In the 70s and 80s, communication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies was not as efficient as it is today. This made it harder for investigators to identify connections between crimes and track down serial killers.

3. Social and cultural attitudes: In the 70s and 80s, there was a greater tolerance for violence and a lack of awareness about the prevalence of serial killers. This made it easier for serial killers to operate without raising suspicion.

4. Lack of public awareness: In the 70s and 80s, there was a lack of public awareness about the dangers of serial killers. This made it easier for them to operate without attracting attention.

5. Lack of resources: In the 70s and 80s, law enforcement agencies had limited resources and personnel. This made it harder for them to investigate and track down serial killers.

Overall, the combination of these factors allowed serial killers to operate undetected for extended periods in the 70s and 80s. However, advances in forensic science, communication and information sharing, and public awareness have made it much harder for serial killers to evade detection today.
