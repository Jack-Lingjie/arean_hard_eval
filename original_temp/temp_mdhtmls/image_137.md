Great question! Here are some ideas to consider during your gap year before starting your PhD program:

1. Research experience: Consider seeking out research opportunities in computational neuroscience or related fields. This could involve working in a lab, attending conferences, or collaborating with other researchers. This will not only help you gain valuable experience, but also allow you to network with potential mentors and colleagues.

2. Language proficiency: If English is not your first language, consider taking language courses or tutoring to improve your proficiency. This will not only help you communicate more effectively, but also demonstrate your commitment to academic excellence.

3. Teaching experience: Consider teaching or tutoring in a classroom or online setting. This will not only help you develop your communication and teaching skills, but also allow you to gain experience working with students.

4. Professional development: Consider attending workshops, conferences, or seminars related to your field of study. This will not only help you stay up-to-date on the latest research and developments, but also allow you to network with other professionals in your field.

5. Volunteer work: Consider volunteering in a related field, such as a hospital, research lab, or non-profit organization. This will not only help you gain valuable experience, but also allow you to give back to your community.

6. Personal growth: Consider taking courses or workshops related to personal growth, such as mindfulness, meditation, or yoga. This will not only help you manage stress and improve your well-being, but also allow you to develop skills that can be applied to your academic and professional pursuits.

Remember, the most important thing is to find an activity that aligns with your interests and goals. Good luck with your applications!
