There are several popular libraries for developing deep learning scripts in Python. Some of the best ones include:
1. TensorFlow: Developed by Google, TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library for deep learning and machine learning. It is widely used for research and production applications.
2. PyTorch: PyTorch is another popular deep learning library developed by Facebook. It is known for its flexibility, ease of use, and strong community support.
3. Keras: Keras is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. It is built on top of TensorFlow or Theano and is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
4. Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library that includes support for deep learning models. It is widely used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
5. MXNet: MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Amazon. It is known for its scalability, flexibility, and support for multiple programming languages.
6. Caffe: Caffe is a deep learning framework developed by the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) lab. It is known for its speed, flexibility, and support for multiple programming languages.
7. Chainer: Chainer is a deep learning framework developed by Preferred Networks. It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and support for multiple programming languages.
8. Theano: Theano is a deep learning library developed by the University of Montreal. It is known for its speed, flexibility, and support for multiple programming languages.
These are just a few of the many libraries available for developing deep learning scripts in Python. The best library for your project will depend on your specific needs and requirements.
