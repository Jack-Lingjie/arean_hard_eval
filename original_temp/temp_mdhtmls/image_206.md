Verse 1:
In the 80s, a teenager's life was a whirlwind
From the streets of London to the clubs in the night
With a mix of joy and sorrow, they danced and they cried
The music was their guide, the Talking Heads their pride

Chorus:
Oh, the 80s, a time of change and discovery
A world of neon and synth, a place to be free
The teenagers of Britain, they were the future
With their style and their spirit, they were the best

Verse 2:
They wore their hair in mohawks and ripped jeans
They listened to the Cure and the Clash, they were the scene
They partied hard and lived fast, they didn't care
They were the generation that dared to be different, to be fair

Chorus:
Oh, the 80s, a time of change and discovery
A world of neon and synth, a place to be free
The teenagers of Britain, they were the future
With their style and their spirit, they were the best

Verse 3:
They faced challenges and struggles, they had their share
But they never gave up, they always pushed through the air
They were the ones who made a difference, who stood up and fought
They were the ones who changed the world, who made it right

Chorus:
Oh, the 80s, a time of change and discovery
A world of neon and synth, a place to be free
The teenagers of Britain, they were the future
With their style and their spirit, they were the best

Verse 4:
They were the ones who made a difference, who stood up and fought
They were the ones who changed the world, who made it right
They were the ones who made a difference, who stood up and fought
They were the ones who changed the world, who made it right

Chorus:
Oh, the 80s, a time of change and discovery
A world of neon and synth, a place to be free
The teenagers of Britain, they were the future
With their style and their spirit, they were the best
