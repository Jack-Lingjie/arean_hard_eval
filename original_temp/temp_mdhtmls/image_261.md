Sarcoidosis is like a little friend who sometimes visits your body. It's like a small group of friends who come to play, but they don't always know where to go or what to do. Sometimes they can make your body feel a little sick, but they usually go away on their own. Just like when you have a friend who needs a little help finding their way, sometimes doctors need to help these little friends find their way out of your body.
