Warmth can make you feel tired for several reasons. One possible explanation is that when your body temperature rises, it triggers a physiological response that causes you to feel sleepy. This is because your body is trying to conserve energy and cool down by reducing physical activity. Additionally, being in a warm environment can also make you feel drowsy due to the release of certain hormones, such as melatonin, which are associated with sleep. Finally, being in a warm environment can also make you feel more relaxed and comfortable, which can lead to feelings of tiredness.
