The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, space-based observatory that is designed to study the early universe, galaxies, stars, and planets. It is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is expected to provide even more detailed and accurate observations of the cosmos. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who served as the second administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968. JWST is a joint project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). It is scheduled to launch in 2021 and will be placed in a halo orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2) of the Sun-Earth system. JWST will have a primary mirror that is 6.5 meters in diameter, which is larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. It will also have four science instruments that will allow it to observe in the infrared spectrum. JWST is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the universe and will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies, stars, and planets.
