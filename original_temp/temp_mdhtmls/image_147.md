The language you described is called "Leet speak" or "1337" (pronounced "leet"). It is a type of shorthand used primarily in online communication, where letters are replaced with numbers or symbols to make them more difficult to read for outsiders. For example, the letter "I" is often replaced with "1", "L" with "7", "E" with "3", and so on. The word "IL9op" in Leet speak would be "1L9op".
