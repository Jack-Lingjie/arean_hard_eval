Mankind discovered that the Earth was spherical through a combination of observations, experiments, and logical reasoning. The ancient Greeks, particularly Pythagoras, Anaximander, and Eratosthenes, made significant contributions to this understanding. They observed that the Earth cast a circular shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, which suggested a spherical shape. Additionally, they noticed that the Sun and stars appeared to rise and set at different points on the horizon throughout the year, indicating that the Earth must be curved. Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference by measuring the angle of the Sun's rays at different locations and using trigonometry. Initially, many people believed the Earth to be flat due to the limited understanding of geography and the lack of evidence to the contrary. However, as more observations and experiments were conducted, the spherical nature of the Earth became widely accepted.
