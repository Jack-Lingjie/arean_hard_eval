In a galaxy far, far away, Anakin Skywalker, a young and ambitious Jedi, found himself on a mission to a distant planet. As he landed on the planet's surface, he was greeted by a mysterious figure dressed in a tailored suit and top hat, speaking with a refined British accent. The figure introduced himself as Lord Tiberius, a Jedi Master from the ancient order of the Knights of the Round Table.

Lord Tiberius led Anakin through the planet's lush forests, regaling him with tales of his adventures in the galaxy. He spoke of his encounters with legendary Jedi Masters, his battles against dark forces, and his love for the Force. Anakin was captivated by Lord Tiberius' stories, and the two quickly formed a bond.

As they walked, Lord Tiberius shared his wisdom and teachings with Anakin, guiding him on the path of the Jedi. He spoke of the importance of honor, integrity, and selflessness, and encouraged Anakin to always strive for the greater good. Anakin listened intently, absorbing every word and learning from Lord Tiberius' experience.

As the sun began to set, Lord Tiberius led Anakin to a clearing in the forest, where a campfire had been prepared. They sat together, sharing stories and laughter, as the flames danced in the night sky. Anakin felt a deep sense of connection with Lord Tiberius, and knew that he had found a true friend and mentor.

As the night wore on, Lord Tiberius shared a secret with Anakin: he was actually a time traveler from the 1920s, having been transported to the galaxy by a mysterious force. He explained that he had been sent to the galaxy to help guide the Jedi in their fight against the dark side, and that he had been searching for a worthy apprentice to train.

Anakin was stunned by this revelation, but he knew that he could not turn away from the opportunity to learn from such a wise and experienced Jedi. He accepted Lord Tiberius' offer, and the two began their journey together, traveling through time and space, fighting against the dark forces that threatened the galaxy.

Together, Anakin and Lord Tiberius faced many challenges and obstacles, but they always emerged victorious, thanks to their unwavering faith in the Force and their unbreakable bond. As the years passed, Anakin grew into a powerful and respected Jedi, and Lord Tiberius became a beloved mentor and friend.

In the end, Anakin and Lord Tiberius parted ways, each going their separate ways to continue their missions in the galaxy. But they would always remember the time they spent together, and the lessons they had learned from each other. And they knew that, no matter what challenges lay ahead, they would always have each other's backs, just as they had in the 1920s.
