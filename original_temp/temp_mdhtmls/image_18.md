Cats rub up against your legs for several reasons. One reason is to mark their territory with their scent. Cats have scent glands in their cheeks, chin, and paws, and when they rub against you, they leave their scent on you. This helps them establish their territory and feel more secure in their environment. Another reason cats rub against you is to show affection. Cats often rub against their owners as a way of saying "I love you" or "I trust you." They may also rub against you to get your attention or to ask for something, such as food or playtime. Finally, cats may rub against you to relieve stress or anxiety. When cats are feeling stressed or anxious, they may seek out physical contact with their owners as a way of feeling more secure and relaxed.
