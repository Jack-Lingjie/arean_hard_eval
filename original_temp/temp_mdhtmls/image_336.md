Verse 1:
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Debugging ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the errors rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Chorus:
Another one crashes the code
Another one crashes the code
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one crashes the code, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one crashes the code

Verse 2:
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the errors rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

Chorus:
Another one crashes the code
Another one crashes the code
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one crashes the code
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one crashes the code

Bridge:
Hey
Oh, take it
Crash the code, hey
Another one crashes the code
Another one crashes the code, ow
Another one crashes the code, hey hey
Another one crashes the code, hey-eh-eh
Ooh

Verse 3:
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a programmer
And bring him to the ground
You can debug him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the errors rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

Chorus:
Another one crashes the code
Another one crashes the code
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one crashes the code, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one crashes the code
