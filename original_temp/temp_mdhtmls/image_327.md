Certainly! The reference you are looking for is the United States Supreme Court case of United States v. Lanza (1964). In this case, the Court upheld the conviction of a man who had falsified the signatures and testimony of more than 200 doctors in order to support a false claim that marijuana was a dangerous and addictive drug. The case was significant in establishing the legal precedent that falsifying evidence is a serious crime, and that individuals who engage in such behavior can be held accountable for their actions.
