 Kubdari is a traditional Georgian dish that consists of a meat-filled pastry. Here is a recipe for you to try:

Ingredients:

* 1 lb ground beef or lamb
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp ground coriander
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp dried mint
* 1/2 tsp dried dill
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 package puff pastry (thawed if frozen)
* 1 egg, beaten for egg wash

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, onion, salt, black pepper, coriander, cumin, paprika, dried mint, dried dill, and red pepper flakes (if using). Mix well until everything is evenly distributed.

2. Add the beaten egg and water to the meat mixture, and mix until well combined.

3. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

4. Unroll the puff pastry onto a lightly floured surface. Cut the pastry into 4 equal rectangles.

5. Divide the meat mixture into 4 equal portions. Place a portion of the meat mixture in the center of each pastry rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges.

6. Fold the edges of the pastry over the meat mixture, pinching the edges together to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges, if desired.

7. Place the kubdari on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops of the kubdari with the beaten egg.

8. Bake the kubdari for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the meat is cooked through.

9. Serve the kubdari hot, with a side of fresh herbs and a dollop of sour cream, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious Georgian kubdari!
