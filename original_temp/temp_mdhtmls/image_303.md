 As a dating coach, I would approach the situation with empathy and understanding. I would greet the woman warmly and express my understanding of her lateness. I would then suggest that we take a moment to catch up and get to know each other better before we start the date simulation. This would help to create a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere, and would also give the woman a chance to explain her lateness. I would then proceed with the date simulation, ensuring that the woman feels comfortable and supported throughout the process.
