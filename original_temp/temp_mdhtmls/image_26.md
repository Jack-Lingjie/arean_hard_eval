The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are caused by the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and charged particles from the sun. These particles are carried by the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that constantly flows from the sun. When the solar wind interacts with the Earth's magnetic field, it creates a region of charged particles called the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere acts as a shield, protecting the Earth from the solar wind's harmful effects. However, some of the charged particles can become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field, causing them to collide with atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere. This collision creates a beautiful display of colorful lights, known as the northern lights.
