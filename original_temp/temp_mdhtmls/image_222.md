In general terms, the distinction between computer organization and computer architecture lies in their respective scopes and levels of abstraction. Computer architecture refers to the design and implementation of the fundamental components and principles that govern the overall structure and operation of a computer system. It encompasses the hardware components, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices, and the communication pathways between them. Computer architecture also includes the instruction set architecture (ISA), which defines the set of instructions that the CPU can execute, as well as the addressing modes and data types supported by the system. In contrast, computer organization focuses on the internal details of the hardware components and their interconnections, including the design of the CPU, memory, and input/output devices. It delves into the specific implementation of the hardware components, such as the number of registers, the size of the cache, and the organization of the memory hierarchy. Computer organization also addresses the control and sequencing of the hardware components, including the design of the control unit and the microprogramming of the CPU. In summary, computer architecture provides a high-level view of the overall system, while computer organization delves into the specific details of the hardware components and their interconnections.
