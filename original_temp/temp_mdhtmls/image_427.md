With love and devotion, I'll always be true,
For 20 years, you've been my guiding light through.
Your smile, your laughter, your gentle touch,
Have filled my heart with joy and made it so much.
You're the one who makes my world complete,
The love of my life, my heart's beat.
Through the good times and the bad,
You've stood by me, a rock, you've always had.
I'll cherish every moment we've shared,
And promise to love you, always, with care.
For you, my Valentine, I'll always be true,
For 20 years, and forever, I'll love you.
