Here's a quick and efficient office workout routine that you can do in just 10 minutes:

1. Wall sit: Stand with your back against a wall, then slowly lower yourself into a sitting position, keeping your knees at a 90-degree angle. Hold for 30 seconds, then stand up and repeat 3 times.
2. Chair dips: Sit on the edge of a chair with your hands behind you, then lower your body down until your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle. Push back up to the starting position and repeat 10 times.
3. Tricep dips: Sit on the edge of a chair with your hands behind you, then lift your hips off the chair and lower your body down until your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle. Push back up to the starting position and repeat 10 times.
4. Plank: Get into a push-up position, then lower your body down onto your forearms. Hold for 30 seconds, then rest for 30 seconds. Repeat 3 times.
5. Leg raises: Lie on your back with your legs straight, then lift your legs up towards the ceiling. Lower them back down and repeat 10 times.

Remember to take breaks and stretch throughout the day to prevent muscle soreness.
