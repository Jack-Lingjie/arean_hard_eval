The second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to specific receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, causing the release of calcium ions into the cytosol. This process is an important part of cellular signaling and is involved in many physiological processes, such as muscle contraction, hormone secretion, and gene expression.
