Hops are typically added to the brewing process during two stages: during the boil and as a dry hop addition. The first addition of hops, known as the "bittering hops," is added at the beginning of the boil to provide bitterness to the beer. The second addition, known as the "flavor hops," is added later in the boil to contribute flavor and aroma to the beer. Dry hopping, which involves adding hops to the fermenter after fermentation is complete, is used to further enhance the aroma of the beer.
