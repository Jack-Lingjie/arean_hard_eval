The earliest evidence of human existence dates back to approximately 2.6 million years ago, with the discovery of the fossilized remains of the species Australopithecus anamensis in Kenya. However, it is important to note that the earliest evidence of human-like traits, such as tool use and complex social behavior, can be traced even further back in time. For example, the discovery of stone tools in Ethiopia suggests that early hominins were using tools as early as 3.3 million years ago. Additionally, the discovery of fossilized footprints in Tanzania indicates that early hominins were walking upright as early as 3.7 million years ago. Therefore, while the earliest evidence of human existence is approximately 2.6 million years ago, there is good reason to believe that human-like traits and behaviors may have emerged even earlier in our evolutionary history.
