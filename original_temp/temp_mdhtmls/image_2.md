Of course! Kickball is a fun and easy-to-learn game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Here's a quick rundown of how it's played:

1. The game is played between two teams, each with nine players on the field. The teams take turns batting and fielding.

2. The game starts with a pitch from the pitcher to the batter. The batter tries to hit the ball with a kick, and if they do, they can run to first base.

3. If the ball is caught by a fielder before it touches the ground, the batter is out. If the ball is hit and rolls past a fielder, the batter can advance to the next base.

4. The game continues until one team scores enough runs to win. A run is scored when a player from the batting team successfully reaches home plate.

5. There are also some additional rules, such as the fact that a player can only advance one base at a time, and that a player can be tagged out if they are not touching a base when the ball is thrown to them.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
