Queue is both an ADT (Abstract Data Type) and a data structure. It is an ADT because it defines a set of operations that can be performed on a queue, such as enqueue (add an element to the end of the queue), dequeue (remove an element from the front of the queue), and peek (view the element at the front of the queue without removing it). It is also a data structure because it has a specific implementation, such as a linked list or an array, that stores the elements in a particular order.
