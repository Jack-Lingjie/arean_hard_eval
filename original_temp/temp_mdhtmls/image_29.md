To clean your armpits, follow these steps:

1. Wash your hands thoroughly before touching your armpits to avoid transferring bacteria to the area.

2. Use a mild, fragrance-free soap or body wash to cleanse your armpits. Avoid using harsh soaps or deodorants that can irritate the skin.

3. Gently massage the soap into your armpits, being careful not to scrub too hard, as this can cause irritation.

4. Rinse your armpits thoroughly with warm water to remove all traces of soap.

5. Pat your armpits dry with a clean towel, being careful not to rub too hard, as this can cause irritation.

6. Apply a moisturizer to your armpits to help keep the skin hydrated and prevent irritation.

7. Avoid using antiperspirants or deodorants that contain aluminum, as these can cause irritation and may increase the risk of breast cancer.

8. If you experience any irritation or discomfort, discontinue use of the product and consult a healthcare professional.
