No, a double pane window cannot be more efficient than a triple pane window. The additional glass pane in a triple pane window provides an extra layer of insulation, reducing heat transfer and improving energy efficiency. This is because the air trapped between the panes acts as an insulator, slowing down the movement of heat. In contrast, a single pane window is less efficient than a double pane window because it has only one layer of glass, which allows more heat to pass through. To make a single pane window more efficient, it can be coated with low-emissivity (low-E) glass, which reflects heat back into the room, or filled with an insulating gas like argon or krypton. These modifications can significantly improve the energy efficiency of a single pane window, making it comparable to a double pane window.
