Becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) typically takes around 2-4 years, depending on your educational background and experience. Here are the general steps to become a CPA:

1. Earn a bachelor's degree: Most states require a bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field. Some states may also accept a master's degree in accounting or a related field.

2. Complete 150 hours of college coursework: In addition to the bachelor's degree, most states require 150 hours of college coursework, which can be completed through a combination of undergraduate and graduate coursework.

3. Pass the CPA exam: The CPA exam is a four-part exam that covers topics such as financial accounting, auditing, taxation, and business law. The exam is administered by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) and is typically taken after completing the required coursework.

4. Gain relevant work experience: Most states require a certain amount of work experience in accounting or a related field before becoming a CPA. The specific requirements vary by state, but typically range from 1-2 years.

5. Apply for licensure: Once you have met the educational, experience, and exam requirements, you can apply for licensure in your state. The application process typically involves submitting transcripts, work experience documentation, and passing a background check.

Overall, becoming a CPA can take several years of education, experience, and hard work. However, the rewards of becoming a CPA can be significant, including higher earning potential, professional recognition, and the opportunity to work in a variety of industries.
