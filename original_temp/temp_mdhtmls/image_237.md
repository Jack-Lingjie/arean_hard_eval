In the remote and eerie island of Sylt, nestled in the northern coast of Germany, a sinister force lurks in the shadows, waiting to unleash its malevolent presence. A group of fishermen, drawn by the promise of a bountiful catch, venture into the treacherous waters, unaware of the horrors that await them. As the sun sets, the island transforms into a nightmarish realm, where the line between reality and madness blurs. The fishermen, once strong and resilient, begin to exhibit strange behaviors, their sanity slowly slipping away. The island's inhabitants, once united by their love for the sea, are now torn apart by a force that drives them to commit unspeakable acts. As the body count rises, the fishermen must confront the truth behind the sinister force, a truth that will leave them questioning their own humanity. Will they be able to escape the island's grasp, or will they succumb to its malevolent embrace?
