3. Dry the car: Use a microfiber towel to dry the car, making sure to remove all moisture.

4. Clean the wheels: Use a wheel cleaner and a brush to clean the wheels, then rinse and dry them.

5. Clean the windows: Use a glass cleaner and a microfiber cloth to clean the windows, then dry them with a separate cloth.

6. Clean the interior: Vacuum the interior, then use a cleaner and a microfiber cloth to clean the dashboard, steering wheel, and other surfaces.

7. Protect the paint: Apply a wax or sealant to protect the paint and enhance its shine.
