The Infinite Banking Concept (IBC) is a financial strategy that aims to create a self-sustaining financial system by utilizing a whole life insurance policy as a financial vehicle. The concept was developed by Nelson Nash, an insurance agent, and author of the book "Becoming Your Own Banker." The idea behind IBC is to use the cash value of a whole life insurance policy as a source of funds for various financial needs, such as purchasing a home, starting a business, or funding retirement. By making regular premium payments into the policy, the policyholder can accumulate cash value over time, which can be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals. The concept is based on the idea that by using the policy as a source of funds, the policyholder can avoid the need for traditional bank loans and interest payments, and instead, use the policy's cash value to generate a return on investment.
