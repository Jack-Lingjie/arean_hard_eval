It is impossible to determine the exact number of pages in all the books ever written, as new books are being published every day, and many books are lost or destroyed over time. However, we can estimate the number of pages in all the books ever written by considering the number of books published each year and the average number of pages in each book.

According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), approximately 2.5 million books are published each year worldwide. If we assume that the average book has 300 pages, then the total number of pages in all the books published in a year would be approximately 750 million pages. If we multiply this number by the number of years since the invention of the printing press (approximately 600 years), we get an estimated total of 450 trillion pages in all the books ever written.

Of course, this estimate is just a rough approximation, and it does not take into account the fact that many books are lost or destroyed over time. Additionally, the average number of pages in a book has increased over time, so the actual number of pages in all the books ever written is likely to be much higher than this estimate. Nevertheless, it is clear that the number of pages in all the books ever written is an extremely large number, and it is impossible to determine the exact figure with any degree of certainty.
