When your girlfriend is feeling under the weather, it's important to provide her with nourishing foods that can help her recover. Here are some good options to consider:

1. Clear broth soups: Chicken noodle soup, vegetable soup, or bone broth can help soothe an upset stomach and provide essential nutrients.

2. Steamed vegetables: Steamed broccoli, carrots, or spinach are easy to digest and packed with vitamins and minerals.

3. Whole grains: Oatmeal, quinoa, or brown rice can provide a good source of energy and fiber.

4. Yogurt: Plain yogurt with live cultures can help restore the balance of good bacteria in the gut.

5. Bananas: Bananas are a good source of potassium and can help replenish electrolytes.

6. Chicken or turkey: Lean protein can help support the immune system and aid in recovery.

7. Ginger tea: Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can help soothe an upset stomach.

8. Lemon water: Lemon water can help hydrate and provide a boost of vitamin C.

Remember to avoid spicy, greasy, or acidic foods that can irritate the stomach and make symptoms worse. Also, make sure to offer plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, or broth, to help prevent dehydration.
