Time can seem to slow down in dangerous situations due to a phenomenon known as "perceptual narrowing." This occurs when the brain focuses its attention on a specific task or event, causing other sensory information to be filtered out. In dangerous situations, the brain may prioritize processing information related to the threat, leading to a subjective experience of time slowing down. This can help individuals respond more effectively to the situation, as they have more time to process and react to the threat. However, it is important to note that this perception of time slowing down is subjective and does not necessarily reflect the actual passage of time.
