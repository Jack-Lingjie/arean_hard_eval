FewJoint is a new few-shot learning benchmark for joint dialogue understanding, which provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up. The proposed method guides slot with explicit intent information and introduces a trust gating mechanism to ensure high quality sharing. A Reptile-based meta-learning strategy is also introduced to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. The proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.
