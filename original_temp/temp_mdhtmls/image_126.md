Hello! The Smith & Wesson 1006 is a semi-automatic pistol chambered in .41 Action Express. To load the gun, you'll need to use .41 AE ammunition. Here are the steps to load the gun:

1. Make sure the gun is unloaded by checking the chamber and the magazine. If there is a round in the chamber, remove it by pulling the slide back and releasing it.

2. Insert a loaded magazine into the gun, making sure it is fully seated and locked in place.

3. Pull the slide back slightly and release it, allowing a round to chamber.

4. Check to make sure the gun is loaded by looking at the chamber and the magazine. The chamber should have a round in it, and the magazine should have rounds remaining.

5. If you need to unload the gun, remove the magazine and pull the slide back to eject any rounds in the chamber.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
