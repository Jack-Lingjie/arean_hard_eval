In the depths of my soul, I find solace in the light
A burning passion, a fire that never dies
I'll follow where He leads, no matter what the night
For He is my salvation, my reason to survive
I'll stand by His side, through the darkest of days
For His love is unending, His grace will never fade
I'll sing His praises, with all of my heart
For He is the one who gives me strength to start
I'll never turn away, no matter what they say
For He is my savior, my hope and my way
I'll hold on to His promise, no matter what they do
For He is the one who loves me, and He loves you too
