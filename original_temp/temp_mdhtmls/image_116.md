 Sure! Here's a simple recipe for peanut brittle:

Ingredients:

* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup light corn syrup
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 cup salted peanuts, coarsely chopped
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions:

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water. Stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil, without stirring, and cook until it reaches 300Â°F (hard crack stage) on a candy thermometer.

2. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the peanuts, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir until the mixture is well combined and the peanuts are evenly distributed.

3. Pour the mixture onto a greased baking sheet and spread it out into a thin layer. Let it cool completely at room temperature.

4. Once the brittle has cooled, break it into pieces and store it in an airtight container. Enjoy your homemade peanut brittle!

Note: Be careful when working with hot sugar, as it can cause burns. Always use caution and wear protective gear, such as oven mitts and safety glasses, when handling hot sugar.
