Taking care of a wooden table is essential to maintain its beauty and longevity. Here are some tips to help you keep your wooden table in top condition:

1. Clean regularly: Dust your wooden table daily using a soft, dry cloth or a microfiber cloth. This will prevent dust from settling into the wood's pores and causing damage.

2. Avoid direct sunlight: Excessive exposure to sunlight can cause the wood to fade and dry out. Keep your wooden table away from direct sunlight or use curtains to block the sun's rays.

3. Use coasters: Place coasters under glasses, cups, and plates to prevent water rings and stains. Water can seep into the wood and cause discoloration or warping.

4. Protect from heat: Avoid placing hot items directly on the wooden table, as this can cause the wood to warp or crack. Use trivets or placemats to protect the surface.

5. Use a humidifier: Wood can shrink or crack in dry environments. To prevent this, use a humidifier to maintain a relative humidity level of 40-60%.

6. Avoid using harsh chemicals: Do not use abrasive cleaners, bleach, or ammonia-based products on your wooden table. These can damage the wood and strip away its natural oils.

7. Regularly apply wood oil or polish: Apply a thin layer of wood oil or polish to the surface of your wooden table to protect it from moisture and keep it looking shiny and new.

8. Repair scratches: If your wooden table has scratches, you can repair them by sanding the area lightly and applying a matching wood filler. Once dry, sand the area again and apply a coat of wood oil or polish.

By following these tips, you can keep your wooden table looking beautiful and in excellent condition for years to come.
