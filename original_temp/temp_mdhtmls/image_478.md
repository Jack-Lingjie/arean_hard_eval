Of course! Here's an email you can send to your friends inviting them to dinner on Friday:

Subject: Dinner Invitation - Friday, 7pm

Hi friends,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to invite you to join me for dinner on Friday at 7pm. I'm excited to catch up and share a meal together. Please let me know if you're available and if you have any dietary restrictions so I can plan accordingly.

Looking forward to seeing you soon!

Best,
[Your Name]
