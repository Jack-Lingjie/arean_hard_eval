Hi! It sounds like you're experiencing an issue with Anki's browser feature. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the problem:

1. Check for updates: Make sure you have the latest version of Anki installed. You can check for updates by going to the "Help" menu and selecting "Check for Updates."

2. Restart Anki: Sometimes, simply restarting Anki can resolve the issue. Try closing the program and reopening it to see if the problem persists.

3. Clear cache and data: If the issue persists, try clearing the cache and data for Anki. To do this, go to your device's settings, select "Apps," find Anki in the list, and select "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data."

4. Reinstall Anki: If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Anki. This can help resolve any issues with the program's installation.

I hope one of these steps helps resolve the issue with Anki's browser feature. Let me know if you have any further questions!
