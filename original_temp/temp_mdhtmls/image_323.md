To stream at 720p 30fps to Twitch while playing an online video game, you should aim for a minimum upload speed of around 3 Mbps (3000 kbps). This will ensure a smooth streaming experience without any buffering or lag. However, it's always a good idea to have some extra headroom, so I would recommend aiming for an upload speed of at least 4 Mbps (4000 kbps) to account for any fluctuations in your internet connection. This will help ensure that both your Twitch stream and online gameplay remain smooth and uninterrupted.
