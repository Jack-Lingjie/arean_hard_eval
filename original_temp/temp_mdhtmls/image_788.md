Here's a Python implementation of a dynamic programming solution to find the nth Fibonacci number:

```python
def fibonacci_dynamic(n):
    # Initialize a list to store Fibonacci numbers
    fib = [0] * (n + 1)

    # Base case (n = 0)
    fib[0] = 0

    # Base case (n = 1)
    fib[1] = 1

    # Fill in the rest of the list using dynamic programming
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]

    return fib[n]

# Example usage
print(fibonacci_dynamic(10))  # Output: 55
```

In this implementation, we use a list `fib` to store the Fibonacci numbers up to the `n`th term. We initialize the list with `0` values, and then set the first two terms (base cases) to `0` and `1`, respectively. We then use a loop to fill in the rest of the list using the dynamic programming approach, where each term is calculated as the sum of the previous two terms. Finally, we return the `n`th term from the list.
