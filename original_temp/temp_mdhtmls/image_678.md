In Python, the input() function is used to prompt the user for input and return the input as a string. Here's an example of how to use the input() function:

```python
# Prompt the user for input
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Print the input
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

This will output:

```Enter your name: John
Hello, John!
```
