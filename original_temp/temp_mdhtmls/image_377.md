No, it is not possible to cook an egg using direct sunlight in any place of our solar system. The intensity of sunlight varies greatly across the solar system, and even on Earth, the amount of sunlight needed to cook an egg is much higher than what is available. Additionally, the temperature of the egg would need to be raised to a high enough temperature to cook it, which would require a significant amount of time and energy. Therefore, it is not possible to cook an egg using direct sunlight in any place of our solar system.
