Based on the information available, I would rank the companies in the following order from most pro-consumer to least pro-consumer:

1. Nintendo
2. Google
3. Microsoft
4. Sony
5. EA

Here are some reasons for this ranking:

Nintendo: Nintendo has a reputation for being pro-consumer, with a focus on creating games and experiences that are accessible and enjoyable for players of all ages and skill levels. They also prioritize customer service and support, and have a history of listening to feedback from players and making changes to improve their products.

Google: Google has a strong commitment to user privacy and data security, and has implemented various measures to protect user information. They also offer a wide range of free services and tools, such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Maps, which can be very useful for consumers.

Microsoft: Microsoft has made efforts to improve its products and services in recent years, and has implemented features such as Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold discounts to make gaming more accessible and affordable for consumers. They also offer a range of free services, such as Office Online and OneDrive, which can be useful for consumers.

Sony: Sony has a reputation for being less pro-consumer than some of its competitors, with a focus on creating high-end products and services that are aimed at a more niche market. They also have a history of charging high prices for their products, which can make them less accessible for some consumers.

EA: Electronic Arts (EA) has a reputation for being less pro-consumer than some of its competitors, with a focus on creating games that are designed to generate revenue through microtransactions and other monetization strategies. They have also been criticized for their treatment of players, with some games being criticized for having unfair or exploitative gameplay mechanics.

It's worth noting that these rankings are based on general perceptions and may not reflect the specific policies or practices of each company. Additionally, companies can change their policies and practices over time, so these rankings may not be accurate in the future.
