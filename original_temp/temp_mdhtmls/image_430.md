The 5-second rule is a popular belief that states food dropped on the floor can be considered safe to eat if picked up within 5 seconds. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Bacteria can transfer to food within seconds, and the longer food remains on the floor, the greater the risk of contamination. It is best to avoid eating food that has been dropped on the floor, regardless of how quickly it is picked up.
