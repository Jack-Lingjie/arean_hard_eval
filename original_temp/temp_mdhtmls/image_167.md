The black cabinet member who went on to play an important role in the civil rights movement was Robert C. Weaver. He was the first African American to serve in a presidential cabinet, appointed by President John F. Kennedy as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1966. Weaver's tenure at HUD marked a significant milestone in the fight for racial equality and paved the way for future African American leaders in government.
