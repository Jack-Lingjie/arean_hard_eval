As a business professional, I would advise my mentee to focus on the following essential points to create a self-sustaining business within the next five years without the help of external investors:

1. Define a clear and compelling value proposition: A strong value proposition is the foundation of a successful business. It should clearly communicate the unique benefits and advantages that your product or service offers to your target customers. This will help you attract and retain customers, build brand loyalty, and differentiate your business from competitors.

2. Conduct thorough market research: Before launching your business, it's essential to conduct thorough market research to understand your target market, their needs, preferences, and buying behavior. This will help you identify potential opportunities and challenges, and develop a comprehensive business plan that addresses these factors.

3. Develop a solid business plan: A well-crafted business plan is a roadmap for your business's success. It should outline your business goals, strategies, and tactics, as well as your financial projections and milestones. A business plan will help you stay focused, organized, and accountable, and provide a clear path to achieving your goals.

4. Build a strong team: Building a strong team is critical to the success of any business. You need to hire talented and experienced individuals who share your vision and values, and who can contribute to the growth and development of your business. Look for individuals who have the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to help you achieve your goals.

5. Focus on customer satisfaction: Customer satisfaction is the key to building a loyal customer base and driving repeat business. Make sure you deliver high-quality products or services that meet or exceed your customers' expectations, and provide excellent customer service to ensure their satisfaction.

6. Leverage technology and automation: Technology and automation can help you streamline your operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. Look for ways to leverage technology to automate repetitive tasks, improve communication and collaboration, and enhance customer engagement.

7. Monitor and analyze your performance: Regularly monitoring and analyzing your performance will help you identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions. Use metrics such as sales, revenue, customer acquisition, and retention rates to track your progress and make adjustments as needed.

8. Stay focused and persistent: Building a self-sustaining business takes time, effort, and persistence. Stay focused on your goals, and don't get discouraged by setbacks or challenges. Keep learning, adapting, and growing, and never stop striving for excellence.

By following these essential points, my mentee can create a self-sustaining business within the next five years without the help of external investors. Remember, building a successful business requires hard work, dedication, and a commitment to continuous improvement. Good luck!
