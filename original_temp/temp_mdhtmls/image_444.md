It is not possible to walk around the world in a single trip, as the Earth is a sphere and the distance around its equator is approximately 24,901 miles (40,075 km). At an average walking speed of 3 miles (4.8 km) per hour, it would take approximately 8,337 hours or 347 days to walk around the world. However, this assumes a continuous, non-stop walk without any breaks or rest, which is not practical or safe. Additionally, there are many other factors to consider, such as terrain, weather, and accessibility, which would make the journey even more challenging.
