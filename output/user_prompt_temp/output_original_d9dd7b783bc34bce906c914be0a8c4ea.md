Prove the converse of Proposition 1.2.8: Let S ⊂ R be nonempty and
bounded above, and let b0 be an upper bound of S. If
∀ ϵ > 0 ∃ x ∈ S : x > b0 − ϵ, (1)
then b0 = sup S

To prove the converse of Proposition 1.2.8, we need to show that if b0 is an upper bound of S and satisfies the given condition (1), then b0 is the least upper bound (supremum) of S.

Recall the definition of supremum: A number b is the supremum of a set S if it is an upper bound of S and for any other upper bound b', b ≤ b'.

We are given that b0 is an upper bound of S, so we just need to show that for any other upper bound b', b0 ≤ b'.

Let b' be any other upper bound of S. We want to show that b0 ≤ b'. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that b0 > b'. Then, we can find a positive ϵ such that b0 - ϵ > b'. Since b' is an upper bound of S, this means that b0 - ϵ is also an upper bound of S.

However, according to condition (1), for any ϵ > 0, there exists an x ∈ S such that x > b0 - ϵ. This means that there exists an element x in S that is greater than the upper bound b0 - ϵ, which is a contradiction since b0 - ϵ is supposed to be an upper bound of S.

Therefore, our assumption that b0 > b' must be false, and we conclude that b0 ≤ b'. Since this holds for any other upper bound b', b0 is the least upper bound (supremum) of S, and we have proven the converse of Proposition 1.2.8:

If b0 is an upper bound of S and satisfies condition (1), then b0 = sup S.

**Converse of Proposition 1.2.8**

### Problem Statement

Prove the converse of Proposition 1.2.8:

- Let \(S\) be a nonempty subset of the real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\) that is bounded above.
- Let \(b_0\) be an upper bound of \(S\).
- If for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(x \in S\) such that \(x > b_0 - \epsilon\), then \(b_0 = \sup S\).

### Solution

To prove that \(b_0 = \sup S\), we need to show two things:

1. **\(b_0\) is an upper bound of \(S\)**: This is given.
2. **\(b_0\) is the least upper bound (supremum) of \(S\)**: We need to show that any number less than \(b_0\) is not an upper bound of \(S\).

### Proof

- **Step 1**: Assume there exists a number \(b < b_0\).
- **Step 2**: Choose \(\epsilon = b_0 - b > 0\).
- **Step 3**: By the given condition, there exists an \(x \in S\) such that \(x > b_0 - \epsilon = b_0 - (b_0 - b) = b\).
- **Step 4**: Since \(x > b\), \(b\) is not an upper bound of \(S\).
- **Step 5**: Therefore, any number less than \(b_0\) is not an upper bound of \(S\).
- **Step 6**: Hence, \(b_0\) is the least upper bound (supremum) of \(S\).

### Conclusion

Given that \(b_0\) is an upper bound of \(S\) and for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(x \in S\) such that \(x > b_0 - \epsilon\), we have shown that \(b_0 = \sup S\).
