Proof that Q(sqrt(-11)) is a principal ideal domain

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To prove that Q(√(-11)) is a principal ideal domain (PID), we need to show that every ideal in the ring of integers of Q(√(-11)) is principal, i.e., generated by a single element.

First, let's find the ring of integers of Q(√(-11)). Since -11 ≡ 1 (mod 4), the ring of integers is given by Z[√(-11)], which consists of elements of the form a + b√(-11) where a, b are integers.

Now, let's use the Minkowski's bound to find the bound on the norms of the elements in the ideal class group. Minkowski's bound is given by:

M = (1/2) * √(Area of the fundamental parallelogram)

For Q(√(-11)), the area of the fundamental parallelogram is 2√11. Therefore, Minkowski's bound is:

M = (1/2) * √(2√11) ≈ 1.49

Since M < 2, we only need to consider the prime ideals with norms 1 and 2. The norm of an element a + b√(-11) is given by N(a + b√(-11)) = a^2 + 11b^2.

1. For norm 1, we have a^2 + 11b^2 = 1. The only solutions are (a, b) = (1, 0) and (-1, 0), which correspond to the trivial ideal (1) and its inverse.

2. For norm 2, we have a^2 + 11b^2 = 2. There are no integer solutions for (a, b), so there are no prime ideals with norm 2.

Since there are no non-trivial prime ideals with norms less than or equal to Minkowski's bound, the ideal class group is trivial, and every ideal in Z[√(-11)] is principal. Therefore, Q(√(-11)) is a principal ideal domain.

**Proof that \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \) is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID)**

To prove that \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \) is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), we need to show that every ideal in this ring is principal.

### Step 1: Define the Ring

The ring \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \) consists of elements of the form \( a + b\sqrt{-11} \), where \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \).

### Step 2: Establish the Norm

For any element \( \alpha = a + b\sqrt{-11} \) in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \), define the norm \( N(\alpha) = (a + b\sqrt{-11})(a - b\sqrt{-11}) = a^2 + 11b^2 \).

### Step 3: Show the Norm Property

- **Multiplicative Property**: For any \( \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \), \( N(\alpha\beta) = N(\alpha)N(\beta) \).
- **Non-Negativity**: For any \( \alpha \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \), \( N(\alpha) \geq 0 \).
- **Zero Divisor**: If \( N(\alpha) = 0 \), then \( \alpha = 0 \).

### Step 4: Prove Every Ideal is Principal

Let \( I \) be an ideal in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \). We aim to show that \( I \) is principal.

- **Case 1**: If \( I = \{0\} \), then \( I \) is principal.
- **Case 2**: If \( I \neq \{0\} \), let \( \alpha \in I \) be a non-zero element with the smallest positive norm. We claim that \( I = (\alpha) \).

### Step 5: Show \( I = (\alpha) \)

- **Step 1**: For any \( \beta \in I \), we have \( N(\beta) = N(\alpha)N(\gamma) \) for some \( \gamma \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \).
- **Step 2**: Since \( N(\alpha) \) is minimal, \( N(\gamma) = 1 \), implying \( \gamma \in \mathbb{Q} \).
- **Step 3**: Therefore, \( \beta = \alpha\gamma \in (\alpha) \), showing that \( I \subseteq (\alpha) \).
- **Step 4**: Since \( \alpha \in I \), we also have \( (\alpha) \subseteq I \), thus \( I = (\alpha) \).

### Conclusion

Every ideal in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \) is principal, making it a Principal Ideal Domain (PID).
