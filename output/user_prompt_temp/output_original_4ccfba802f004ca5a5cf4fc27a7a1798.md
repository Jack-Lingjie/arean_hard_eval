Now navigate to this page.  https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html?lang=en 
On the left rail, there is a menu with nested menus that can be expanded. Extract each menu label and corresponding URLs. Ouput this in a CSV file with one column for the menu label and the other column for the full path url

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot directly access or navigate web pages. However, I can help you with the process of extracting the information you need.

To extract the menu labels and corresponding URLs from the page, you can use a web scraping tool or library, such as BeautifulSoup for Python or Cheerio for JavaScript. Once you have the data, you can save it in a CSV file using a CSV library or by manually formatting the data.

Here's an example using Python and BeautifulSoup:

1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

2. Create a Python script to extract the menu labels and URLs:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv

url = 'https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html?lang=en'

response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

menu_items = soup.select('.side-nav .side-nav-item')

with open('menu_labels_and_urls.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['menu_label', 'url']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()

    for item in menu_items:
        label = item.get_text(strip=True)
        link = item.find('a')['href']
        full_url = f'https://experienceleague.adobe.com{link}'
        writer.writerow({'menu_label': label, 'url': full_url})

print("CSV file created successfully.")
```

This script will create a CSV file named "menu_labels_and_urls.csv" containing the menu labels and their corresponding URLs. Please note that this script may not work if the website structure changes or if the website uses JavaScript to load the menu items. In that case, you might need to use a more advanced web scraping tool like Selenium.
