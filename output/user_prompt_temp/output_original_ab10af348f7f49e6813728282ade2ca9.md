To find the minimum cost for this transhipment problem, we can use the transportation method. First, we need to create a transportation table with the given data:

| Plant/Retail | Kansas City | Lousville | Supply |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Denver       | 3           | 2         | 600    |
| Atlanta      | 2           | 1         | 400    |
| Houston      | 4           | 3         | 500    |
| Demand       | 350         | 750       | 1100   |

| Warehouse/Retail | Detriot | Miami | Dallas | New Orleans | Demand |
|------------------|---------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Kansas City      | 2       | 6     | 3      | 5           | 350    |
| Lousville        | 4       | 4     | 6      | 5           | 750    |
| Supply           | 300     | 250   | 450    | 500         | 1500   |

Now, we can solve the transportation problem using the least-cost method or Vogel's approximation method. After solving, we get the following optimal solution:

| Plant/Retail | Kansas City | Lousville | Supply |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Denver       | 0           | 600       | 600    |
| Atlanta      | 350         | 50        | 400    |
| Houston      | 0           | 500       | 500    |
| Demand       | 350         | 1150      | 1500   |

| Warehouse/Retail | Detriot | Miami | Dallas | New Orleans | Demand |
|------------------|---------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Kansas City      | 0       | 0     | 350    | 0           | 350    |
| Lousville        | 300     | 250   | 100    | 500         | 1150   |
| Supply           | 300     | 250   | 450    | 500         | 1500   |

The minimum cost can be calculated as follows:
(0 * 3) + (600 * 2) + (350 * 2) + (50 * 1) + (0 * 4) + (500 * 3) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 6) + (350 * 3) + (0 * 5) + (300 * 4) + (250 * 4) + (100 * 6) + (500 * 5) = 0 + 1200 + 700 + 50 + 0 + 1500 + 0 + 0 + 1050 + 0 + 1200 + 1000 + 600 + 2500 = 7200

The minimum cost that can be achieved for this transhipment problem is $7200.

If Denver can also directly ship to all the Retail Outlets at $6 cost, the total cost of the optimal solution would increase, as the direct shipping cost is higher than the current optimal solution.

If there is a maximum capacity of 350 units on all flows, the optimal solution would change, and the total cost would likely increase due to the constraint.

The total net flow of the network is the sum of the supply from all plants, which is 600 + 400 + 500 = 1500 units.

In a situation where there is a maximum capacity of 350 units on all flows and all plants can directly ship to all retail outlets at $5, the following statements are true:

Statement 1: The total cost of the optimal solution would likely increase due to the constraint and the higher direct shipping cost.
Statement 2: There might still be flows in Lousville, as it could be part of the optimal solution.
Statement 3: To achieve the optimal solution, all plants will not necessarily have to ship their products directly to the retail outlets, as the warehouses might still be part of the optimal solution.

**Minimum Cost for Transhipment Problem**

The minimum cost for this transhipment problem can be achieved by using the transportation algorithm. 

1. **Step 1**: Calculate the total supply and demand.
   - **Supply**: Denver (600), Atlanta (400), Houston (500)  
   - **Demand**: Detroit (300), Miami (250), Dallas (450), New Orleans (500)

2. **Step 2**: Find the shortest path from each plant to each retail outlet through the warehouses.

   - **Plant 1 (Denver)**:
     - **Path 1**: Denver -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 3 + 2 = 5  
     - **Path 2**: Denver -> Kansas City -> Miami  
       - Cost: 3 + 6 = 9  
     - **Path 3**: Denver -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 3 + 3 = 6  
     - **Path 4**: Denver -> Kansas City -> New Orleans  
       - Cost: 3 + 5 = 8  
     - **Path 5**: Denver -> Louisville -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 2 + 4 = 6  
     - **Path 6**: Denver -> Louisville -> Miami  
       - Cost: 2 + 4 = 6  
     - **Path 7**: Denver -> Louisville -> Dallas

       - Cost: 2 + 5 = 7  

   - **Plant 2 (Atlanta)**:
     - **Path 1**: Atlanta -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 2 + 2 = 4  
     - **Path 2**: Atlanta -> Kansas City -> Miami  
       - Cost: 2 + 6 = 8  
     - **Path 3**: Atlanta -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 2 + 3 = 5  
     - **Path 4**: Atlanta -> Kansas City -> New Orleans  
       - Cost: 2 + 5 = 7  
     - **Path 5**: Atlanta -> Louisville -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 1 + 4 = 5  
     - **Path 6**: Atlanta -> Louisville -> Miami  
       - Cost: 1 + 4 = 5  
     - **Path 7**: Atlanta -> Louisville -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 1 + 6 = 7  
     - **Path 8**: Atlanta -> Louisville -> New Orleans  
       - Cost: 1 + 5 = 6  

   - **Plant 3 (Houston)**:
     - **Path 1**: Houston -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 4 + 2 = 6  
     - **Path 2**: Houston -> Kansas City -> Miami  
       - Cost: 4 + 6 = 10  
     - **Path 3**: Houston -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 4 + 3 = 7  
     - **Path 4**: Houston -> Kansas City -> New Orleans  
       - Cost: 4 + 5 = 9  
     - **Path 5**: Houston -> Louisville -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 3 + 4 = 7  
     - **Path 6**: Houston -> Louisville -> Miami  
       - Cost: 3 + 4 = 7  
     - **Path 7**: Houston -> Louisville -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 3 + 6 = 9  
     - **Path 8**: Houston -> Louisville -> New Orleans  
       - Cost: 3 + 5 = 8  

3. **Step 3**: Allocate the supply to the retail outlets using the shortest paths.

   - **Plant 1 (Denver)**:
     - **Path 1**: Denver -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 5  
       - Allocate: 300 units  
     - **Path 2**: Denver -> Louisville -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 6  
       - Allocate: 0 units  
     - **Path 3**: Denver -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 6  
       - Allocate: 450 units  
     - **Path 4**: Denver -> Kansas City -> New Orleans  
       - Cost: 8  
       - Allocate: 0 units  

   - **Plant 2 (Atlanta)**:
     - **Path 1**: Atlanta -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 4  
       - Allocate: 300 units  
     - **Path 2**: Atlanta -> Louisville -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 5  
       - Allocate: 0 units  
     - **Path 3**: Atlanta -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 5  
       - Allocate: 450 units  
     - **Path 4**: Atlanta -> Louisville -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 7  
       - Allocate: 0 units  

   - **Plant 3 (Houston)**:
     - **Path 1**: Houston -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 6  
       - Allocate: 300 units  
     - **Path 2**: Houston -> Louisville -> Detroit  
       - Cost: 7  
       - Allocate: 0 units  
     - **Path 3**: Houston -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 7  
       - Allocate: 450 units  
     - **Path 4**: Houston -> Louisville -> Dallas  
       - Cost: 9  
       - Allocate: 0 units  

4. **Step 4**: Calculate the total cost.

   - **Total Cost**: 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 9 =  **$120**  

**Effect on Total Cost if Denver Can Directly Ship to Retail Outlets**

If Denver can directly ship to all retail outlets at a cost of $6, the total cost will decrease.

- **Direct Shipping**:  
  - **Detroit**: 300 units  
    - Cost: 6  
  - **Miami**: 250 units  
    - Cost: 6  
  - **Dallas**: 450 units  
    - Cost: 6  
  - **New Orleans**: 500 units  
    - Cost: 6  

- **Total Cost**: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = **$24**  

The total cost decreases from $120 to $24.

**Effect on Total Cost if There is a Maximum Capacity of 350 Units on All Flows**

If there is a maximum capacity of 350 units on all flows, the total cost will increase.

- **Plant 1 (Denver)**:
  - **Path 1**: Denver -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
    - Cost: 5  
    - Allocate: 300 units  
  - **Path 2**: Denver -> Louisville -> Detroit  
    - Cost: 6  
    - Allocate: 0 units  
  - **Path 3**: Denver -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
    - Cost: 6  
    - Allocate: 350 units  
    - Exceeds capacity  
    - Allocate: 350 units  
  - **Path 4**: Denver -> Kansas City -> New Orleans  
    - Cost: 8  
    - Allocate: 0 units  

- **Plant 2 (Atlanta)**:
  - **Path 1**: Atlanta -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
    - Cost: 4  
    - Allocate: 300 units  
  - **Path 2**: Atlanta -> Louisville -> Detroit  
    - Cost: 5  
    - Allocate: 0 units  
  - **Path 3**: Atlanta -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
    - Cost: 5  
    - Allocate: 350 units  
    - Exceeds capacity  
    - Allocate: 350 units  
  - **Path 4**: Atlanta -> Louisville -> Dallas  
    - Cost: 7  
    - Allocate: 0 units  

- **Plant 3 (Houston)**:
  - **Path 1**: Houston -> Kansas City -> Detroit  
    - Cost: 6  
    - Allocate: 300 units  
  - **Path 2**: Houston -> Louisville -> Detroit  
    - Cost: 7  
    - Allocate: 0 units  
  - **Path 3**: Houston -> Kansas City -> Dallas  
    - Cost: 7  
    - Allocate: 350 units  
    - Exceeds capacity  
    - Allocate: 350 units  
  - **Path 4**: Houston -> Louisville -> Dallas  
    - Cost: 9  
    - Allocate: 0 units  

- **Total Cost**: 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 9 = **$133**  

The total cost increases from $120 to $133.

**Total Netflow of the Network**

The total netflow of the network is the difference between the total supply and the total demand.

- **Total Supply**: 600 + 400 + 500 = **$1500**  
- **Total Demand**: 300 + 250 + 450 + 500 = **$1500**  

The total netflow of the network is **$0**.

**Effect of Maximum Capacity and Direct Shipping**

If there is a maximum capacity of 350 units on all flows and all plants can directly ship to all retail outlets at $5, the total cost will decrease.

- **Direct Shipping**:  
  - **Detroit**: 300 units  
    - Cost: 5
