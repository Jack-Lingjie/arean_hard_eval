<|User Prompt|>
Here is my python sqlite3 code:
# Fetch authorized users for the given device
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT users.key FROM users INNER JOIN permissions"
    "ON users.key = permissions.user_key WHERE permissions.device_id = ?",
    (device_id,),
)
authorized_users = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

Got this errror:
   data = Device.get_authorized_users(device_id)
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 File "/home/artsin/Dev/prismo/app/models/device.py", line 58, in get_authorized_users
   cursor.execute(
sqlite3.OperationalError: near ".": syntax error
Why?

The error is due to a missing space between the two strings in your SQL query. When you concatenate the strings, there is no space between "permissions" and "ON", which causes the syntax error. To fix this, add a space at the end of the first string or at the beginning of the second string. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Fetch authorized users for the given device
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT users.key FROM users INNER JOIN permissions "
    "ON users.key = permissions.user_key WHERE permissions.device_id = ?",
    (device_id,),
)
authorized_users = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
```

Now, there is a space between "permissions" and "ON", which should resolve the syntax error.

**SQLite Syntax Error**

The error occurs because of a missing space between the table names in the SQL query.

### Corrected Code

```python
# Fetch authorized users for the given device
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT users.key FROM users "
    "INNER JOIN permissions "
    "ON users.key = permissions.user_key "
    "WHERE permissions.device_id = ?",
    (device_id,)
)

authorized_users = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
```

### Explanation

- The issue arises from the lack of spaces between the table names (`users` and `permissions`) in the SQL query.
- SQLite requires spaces between keywords and identifiers to avoid syntax errors.

### Example Use Case

To use this corrected code:

1. **Fetch Authorized Users**:

    ```python
    device_id = 123  # Replace with the actual device ID
    cursor.execute(
        "SELECT users.key FROM users "
        "INNER JOIN permissions "
        "ON users.key = permissions.user_key "
        "WHERE permissions.device_id = ?",
        (device_id,)
    )
    authorized_users = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
    print(authorized_users)  # Print the list of authorized users
    ```
