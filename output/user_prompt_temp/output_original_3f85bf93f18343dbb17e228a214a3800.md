Here's a chord progression in the key of C major that conveys a sense of sadness and slowness:

**Chord Progression:**
- **C** (tonic)
- **G7** (dominant seventh chord, adding tension)
- **Am** (minor chord, introducing a melancholic feel)
- **F** (subdominant chord, creating a sense of resolution)

**Example:**
C - G7 - Am - F  
C - G7 - Am - F  

This progression creates a somber atmosphere, perfect for a slow and emotional piece. The G7 chord adds a touch of tension, while the Am chord deepens the melancholy. The F chord provides a sense of resolution, but the progression's overall feel remains somber.
