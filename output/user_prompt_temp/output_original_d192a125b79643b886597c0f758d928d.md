B: Great. Let's start with the hotel. Do you have any specific preferences or budget in mind?

A: I'd prefer a 4-star hotel, and my budget is around $150 per night. If there were a hotel with a gym and a pool, that would be perfect.

A: That sounds great! Please book it for me.

A: I'll need a taxi from the airport to the hotel on the 15th, and then from the hotel to the airport on the 20th. I'll be using public transportation during my stay.

B: Okay, I can arrange that for you. If you provide me with your flight details, I can make sure the taxi is waiting for you when you arrive.

A: My flight arrives at 3:00 PM on the 15th, and my departure flight is at 6:00 PM on the 20th.

B: Great, I'll book the taxi accordingly. If your flight were to be delayed, would you like me to include a note for the taxi driver to check your flight status?

A: Yes, please do that. I appreciate your help.

B: No problem at all. I've booked the hotel and the taxi for you. Have a great business trip!
