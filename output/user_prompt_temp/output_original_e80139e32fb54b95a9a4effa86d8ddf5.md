Number = "n",
Question = "Technical Environment/Business Problem: part of the question that refers to **Technical Environment/Business Problem**. Goal Statement: Part of the question that refers to the **Goal Statement**. Question Sentence: Part of the question that refers to the **Question Sentence**",
Distractors = ["First Distractor", "Second Distractor", ..., "Last Distractor"],
Correct_Answers = ["First Correct Answer", "Second Correct Answer", ..., "Last Correct Answer"]
Correct_Reasoning = ["Reasoning on the first correct Answer", "Reasoning on the second correct Answer", ... , "Reasoning on the last correct Answer"]
}

# Guidelines

 - You need to follow the Answer format to provide the answer.
 -  Each distractor and Correct_Answer should be about the same size.

## Question Rules

 - Each question needs to have 3 parts. Each part have its own rules. Please follow the rules contained in each part. The parts are: **Technical Environment/Business Problem**, **Goal Statement**, and **Question Sentence**

### Technical Environment/Business Problem

 - Describe from general to specific
 - Include only necessary information; no extraneous text
 - Questions must not provide cues or clues that will give away the correct answer to an unqualified candidate.

### Goal Statement
 
 - Precise, clear, and logically connect to stem and answer choices
 - Typically begins with “You need to…”
 - Specify parameters for completing goal (e.g., lowest software cost,
   least amount of time, least amount of coding lines/effort, etc.)

### Question Sentence

 - Typically “What should you do?” or “What should you do next?”
 - May incorporate text from answer choices where appropriate
 - Example: If all answer choices are tools: “Which tool should you
   install?”
 - Should not be a negative question; i.e., “Which of the following is
   NOT…”

## Distractor Rules
