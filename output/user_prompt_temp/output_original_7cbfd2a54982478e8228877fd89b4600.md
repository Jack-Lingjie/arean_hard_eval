I am an Android developer. When running my ONNX runtime application, the CPU utilisation is ~40% . How can I increase the CPU usage for my app?

To increase the CPU usage for your ONNX Runtime application, you can try the following methods:

1. Enable parallelism: ONNX Runtime can execute operations in parallel to improve performance. You can enable parallelism by setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable to the number of threads you want to use. For example, you can set it to the number of available CPU cores:

```python
import os
os.environ['OMP_NUM_THREADS'] = str(os.cpu_count())
```

2. Use intra-op and inter-op parallelism: ONNX Runtime provides options to configure intra-op and inter-op parallelism. Intra-op parallelism refers to parallelism within a single operator, while inter-op parallelism refers to parallelism between different operators. You can set these options using the `SessionOptions` object:

```python
import onnxruntime as rt

sess_options = rt.SessionOptions()
sess_options.intra_op_num_threads = os.cpu_count()  # Set the number of threads for intra-op parallelism
sess_options.inter_op_num_threads = 1  # Set the number of threads for inter-op parallelism

sess = rt.InferenceSession("your_model.onnx", sess_options)
```

3. Optimize your model: You can use ONNX's built-in optimization tools to optimize your model for better performance. This can help reduce the computational complexity of your model and potentially increase CPU usage. You can use the ONNX optimizer like this:

```python
from onnx import optimizer

optimized_model = optimizer.optimize(original_model)
```

4. Use ONNX Runtime Execution Providers: ONNX Runtime supports various execution providers like OpenVINO, TensorRT, and DirectML that can help improve the performance of your application. You can choose an execution provider that best suits your hardware and software requirements.

5. Profile your application: Use profiling tools like Python's built-in cProfile or other third-party tools to identify bottlenecks in your application. This can help you find areas where you can optimize your code to improve CPU usage.

Remember that increasing CPU usage might not always lead to better performance, as it can also cause higher power consumption and thermal throttling. It's essential to find a balance between performance and resource utilization.

**Increasing CPU Utilization for ONNX Runtime Applications**

To boost CPU usage for your Android app using ONNX Runtime, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Optimize Model Loading**

- **Preload Models**: Load models in the background before they're needed. This can be done using a separate thread or by utilizing the app's startup time.

### 2. **Use Multiple Threads**

- **Multithreading**: ONNX Runtime supports multithreading. This can significantly improve performance on multi-core CPUs.

### 3. **Increase Model Parallelism**

- **Model Parallelism**: ONNX Runtime allows you to split models into smaller parts and run them in parallel. This can lead to substantial performance improvements.

### 4. **Use the Latest ONNX Runtime Version**

- **Update ONNX Runtime**: Ensure you're using the latest version of ONNX Runtime. Newer versions often include performance optimizations.

### 5. **Profile and Optimize**

- **Profiling**: Use tools like Android Studio's CPU Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in your app.

### Example Code

Here's an example of how to preload models and use multithreading:

```java
// Preload models
new Thread(() -> {
    // Load models here
}).start();

// Use multithreading
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4); // Adjust the thread pool size

// Submit tasks to the executor
executor.submit(() -> {
    // Run model inference here
});

// Shut down the executor when finished
executor.shutdown();
```

### Additional Tips

- **Monitor CPU Usage**: Regularly check CPU usage to ensure your optimizations are effective.
- **Test on Different Devices**: Performance can vary across devices. Test your app on different hardware configurations.

By implementing these strategies, you can increase CPU utilization for your ONNX Runtime application.
