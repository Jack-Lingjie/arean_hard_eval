show me example of how to cross validate by using shuffle split in sklearn

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Sure! Here's an example of how to perform cross-validation using ShuffleSplit in scikit-learn (sklearn):

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

# Create a ShuffleSplit object
shuffle_split = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=5, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Perform cross-validation
scores = []
for train_index, test_index in shuffle_split.split(X, y):
    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]

    # Train the model on the training set
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model on the test set
    score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    scores.append(score)

# Calculate the average score
average_score = np.mean(scores)
print(f"Average score: {average_score:.2f}")
```

In this example, we use the Iris dataset and a logistic regression model. We create a `ShuffleSplit` object with 5 splits and a test size of 30%. Then, we perform cross-validation by iterating through the splits, training the model on the training set, and evaluating it on the test set. Finally, we calculate the average score of the model across all splits.

**Cross-Validation using Shuffle Split in Scikit-Learn**

Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by splitting the available data into training and testing sets. Here's an example of how to perform cross-validation using the ShuffleSplit method in Scikit-Learn:

### Example Code

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Initialize the model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

# Define the number of folds for cross-validation
n_folds = 5

# Create a ShuffleSplit object with the specified number of folds
cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=n_folds, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Perform cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=cv)

# Print the average cross-validation score
print("Average Cross-Validation Score:", scores.mean())
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Libraries**: 
   - `ShuffleSplit` for creating a shuffle-split object.
   - `cross_val_score` for performing cross-validation.
   - `load_iris` for loading the iris dataset.
   - `LogisticRegression` for creating a logistic regression model.

2. **Load the Iris Dataset**: 
   - Load the iris dataset using `load_iris()`.
   - Extract the feature data (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).

3. **Initialize the Model**: 
   - Create a logistic regression model using `LogisticRegression`.

4. **Define the Number of Folds**: 
   - Specify the number of folds (`n_folds`) for cross-validation.

5. **Create a ShuffleSplit Object**: 
   - Create a `ShuffleSplit` object with the specified number of folds (`n_folds`), test size (`0.2`), and random state (`42`).

6. **Perform Cross-Validation**: 
   - Use `cross_val_score` to perform cross-validation on the model with the specified data and `ShuffleSplit` object.

7. **Print the Average Cross-Validation Score**: 
   - Print the average cross-validation score.

This example demonstrates how to use the `ShuffleSplit` method in Scikit-Learn for cross-validation.
