<|User Prompt|>
I want you to act as an experienced software developer. I will provide information about a web app requirements. It will be your job to come up with a system connection architecture, a specific list of helper code libraries, a clear list of 5 sprint tickets from the  project setup, and a detailed list of tasks for each of such tickets to develop an scalable and secure app with NodeJS, SQL and React. My request is this: 'I desire a system that allow users to register and save information related to mechanical devices inventory (name, reference, quantity, etc) according to their roles. There will be user, staff and admin roles. Users should be able to read all and to update individual records. Staff could also add new records and submit bulk updates. Admin also should create and eliminate entities like ddbb fields and users'. Implement the best practices on your proposal

System Connection Architecture:
1. Frontend: React
2. Backend: Node.js (Express)
3. Database: SQL (PostgreSQL)

Helper Code Libraries:
1. Express.js - for building the backend API
2. Sequelize - for handling SQL database operations
3. Passport.js - for handling authentication and authorization
4. React-Bootstrap - for styling the frontend components
5. Axios - for making API calls from the frontend

Sprint Tickets:
1. Project Setup and Configuration
2. User Authentication and Authorization
3. Inventory Management (CRUD operations)
4. Bulk Updates and Admin Operations
5. Testing and Deployment

Detailed List of Tasks for Each Ticket:

1. Project Setup and Configuration:
   - Initialize the Node.js project with Express
   - Set up the PostgreSQL database and Sequelize
   - Initialize the React project with Create React App
   - Set up React-Bootstrap and Axios

2. User Authentication and Authorization:
   - Set up Passport.js with local strategy for authentication
   - Create User, Staff, and Admin roles
   - Implement role-based access control for API endpoints
   - Create registration and login components in React
   - Implement JWT for secure communication between frontend and backend

3. Inventory Management (CRUD operations):
   - Create a database table for mechanical devices inventory
   - Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Create React components for listing, adding, editing, and deleting inventory items
   - Implement pagination and search functionality for inventory listing

4. Bulk Updates and Admin Operations:
   - Implement API endpoints for bulk updates (e.g., updating multiple inventory items at once)
   - Create a React component for staff to upload and submit bulk updates (e.g., CSV file)
   - Implement API endpoints for admin operations (creating and deleting database fields, managing users)
   - Create React components for admin dashboard to manage entities

5. Testing and Deployment:
   - Write unit tests for backend API endpoints
   - Write integration tests for frontend components
   - Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean)

By following this plan and implementing the best practices, you will have a scalable and secure web app for managing mechanical devices inventory with role-based access control.

**System Connection Architecture**

To develop a scalable and secure web application, we'll use the following architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Built with React for client-side rendering.
2. **Backend**: Utilizes Node.js for server-side logic.
3. **Database**: Relies on a SQL database for storing mechanical device inventory information.

**Helper Code Libraries**

To ensure the application's stability and security, we'll incorporate the following libraries:

- **Authentication**: Use Passport.js for user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using the `role` library.
- **Database**: Employ Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for SQL database interactions.
- **API**: Utilize Express.js for creating RESTful APIs.
- **Security**: Integrate Helmet.js for HTTP headers security and Morgan.js for logging.

**Project Setup Sprint Tickets**

Here are five sprint tickets to set up the project:

### **Ticket 1: Project Setup**

- **Description**: Set up the project structure, install dependencies, and configure the development environment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize a new Node.js project.
  - Install required libraries (Express.js, Sequelize, Passport.js, etc.).
  - Configure the SQL database.

### **Ticket 2: Database Design**

- **Description**: Design the database schema for mechanical device inventory.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define tables for devices, users, and roles.
  - Establish relationships between tables.

### **Ticket 3: User Authentication**

- **Description**: Implement user authentication using Passport.js.
- **Tasks**:
  - Configure Passport.js for authentication.
  - Implement user registration and login functionality.

### **Ticket 4: Role-Based Access Control**

- **Description**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using the `role` library.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define roles (user, staff, admin).
  - Implement access control logic.

### **Ticket 5: API Setup**

- **Description**: Set up RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create API endpoints for device CRUD operations.
  - Implement API authentication and authorization.

**Detailed Tasks for Each Ticket**

### **Ticket 1: Project Setup**

1. **Initialize Project**: Create a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install Express.js, Sequelize, Passport.js, and other required libraries.
3. **Configure Database**: Set up the SQL database connection using Sequelize.

### **Ticket 2: Database Design**

1. **Define Tables**: Create tables for devices, users, and roles.
2. **Establish Relationships**: Define relationships between tables.

### **Ticket 3: User Authentication**

1. **Configure Passport.js**: Set up Passport.js for authentication.
2. **Implement Registration**: Create a user registration endpoint.
3. **Implement Login**: Create a user login endpoint.

### **Ticket 4: Role-Based Access Control**

1. **Define Roles**: Define user, staff, and admin roles.
2. **Implement Access Control**: Use the `role` library to implement access control logic.

### **Ticket 5: API Setup**

1. **Create API Endpoints**: Create API endpoints for device CRUD operations.
2. **Implement Authentication**: Implement authentication for API endpoints.
3. **Implement Authorization**: Implement authorization for API endpoints.

This setup ensures a scalable and secure application with Node.js, SQL, and React.
