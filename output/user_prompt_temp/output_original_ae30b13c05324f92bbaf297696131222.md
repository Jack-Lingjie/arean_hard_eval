<|User Prompt|>
Given the user's initial prompt "{{ Generate tags based on the text of each document in my Obsidian vault }}" enhance it.

1. Start with clear, precise instructions placed at the beginning of the prompt.
2. Include specific details about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style.
3. Provide examples of the desired output format, if possible.
4. Use appropriate leading words or phrases to guide the desired output, especially if code generation is involved.
5. Avoid any vague or imprecise language.
6. Rather than only stating what not to do, provide guidance on what should be done instead.

Remember to ensure the revised prompt remains true to the user's original intent.

Create a list of tags for each document in my Obsidian vault by analyzing the text content. Follow these guidelines to enhance the prompt:

1. Begin the prompt with a clear and concise instruction: "Generate a set of relevant tags for each document in my Obsidian vault based on their text content."
2. Provide specific details about the context and desired outcome: "The tags should accurately represent the main topics and themes discussed in each document. The generated tags will help in organizing and searching for related content within the Obsidian vault."
3. Mention the desired length, format, and style: "For each document, generate a list of 5-10 tags, formatted as a comma-separated list (e.g., #tag1, #tag2, #tag3). The tags should be single words or short phrases, written in lowercase and using hyphens to separate words if necessary (e.g., #project-management)."
4. Include examples of the desired output format: "For example, if a document discusses productivity tips and time management, the generated tags could be: #productivity, #time-management, #efficiency, #work-tips, #task-organization."
5. Use leading words or phrases to guide the output, especially if code generation is involved: "To generate the tags, you may use natural language processing techniques or keyword extraction algorithms, such as TF-IDF or RAKE."
6. Avoid vague or imprecise language: "Instead of saying 'avoid irrelevant tags,' specify that 'the generated tags should be closely related to the document's content and not include generic or unrelated terms.'"
7. Provide guidance on what should be done instead of only stating what not to do: "Rather than generating tags that are too broad or generic, focus on identifying specific topics and themes that are central to the document's content."

Revised prompt: "Generate a set of relevant tags for each document in my Obsidian vault based on their text content. The tags should accurately represent the main topics and themes discussed in each document and help in organizing and searching for related content within the vault. For each document, generate a list of 5-10 tags, formatted as a comma-separated list (e.g., #tag1, #tag2, #tag3). The tags should be single words or short phrases, written in lowercase and using hyphens to separate words if necessary (e.g., #project-management). For example, if a document discusses productivity tips and time management, the generated tags could be: #productivity, #time-management, #efficiency, #work-tips, #task-organization.
