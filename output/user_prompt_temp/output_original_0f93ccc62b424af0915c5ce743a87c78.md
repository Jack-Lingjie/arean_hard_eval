First, regarding the PSU: The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3060 has a recommended system power requirement of 550W. Your 450W PSU might not be sufficient to power the GPU, especially if you have other power-hungry components in your system. It is recommended to upgrade your PSU to at least 550W or higher to ensure stable performance and avoid potential issues.

Second, to install the GPU, follow these steps:

1. Power off your computer and unplug it from the wall socket.

2. Open the computer case. This process may vary depending on your Thelio model, but typically involves removing a few screws and sliding or lifting off the side panel.

3. Locate the PCIe x16 slot on your motherboard. This is the long slot, usually closest to the CPU, and is designed for graphics cards.

4. If there is a GPU already installed, remove it by unscrewing any screws securing it to the case and gently pressing down on the PCIe slot release latch while pulling the card out.

5. Align the new GTX 3060 GPU with the PCIe x16 slot, making sure the metal bracket on the GPU lines up with the case's expansion slot opening.

6. Gently but firmly push the GPU into the PCIe slot until it clicks into place. Make sure the GPU is seated properly and the PCIe slot latch is locked.

7. Secure the GPU to the case using the screws you removed earlier (or new ones, if necessary).

8. Connect the required power cables from your PSU to the GPU. The GTX 3060 typically requires one 8-pin or 12-pin power connector, depending on the specific model. If your PSU doesn't have the required connector, you may need to use an adapter or upgrade your PSU.

9. Close the computer case and reconnect all cables, including the power cable.

10. Power on your computer. The system should automatically detect the new GPU.

11. Install the latest NVIDIA drivers for your GTX 3060. You can download them from the NVIDIA website (https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or use the package manager in your Linux distribution to install the appropriate driver package.

After completing these steps, your NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3060 should be installed and ready to use. Remember to monitor your system's temperatures and performance to ensure everything is running smoothly.
