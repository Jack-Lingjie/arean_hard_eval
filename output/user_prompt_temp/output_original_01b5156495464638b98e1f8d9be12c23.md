my chat bot outputs " ### Instruction: <all of its instructions>" at the end of every response. this only seems to happen after it resizes its context memory. what's the likely cause of this bad output and how can i rectify it?

The likely cause of this issue is that the chatbot is including its internal instructions in the output text when its context memory is resized. This might be due to the way the instructions are formatted or processed within the chatbot's code.

To rectify this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Review the code responsible for handling instructions and context memory resizing. Look for any instances where the instructions might be appended to the output text unintentionally.

2. Ensure that the instructions are properly formatted and separated from the output text. You may need to use a different delimiter or method to distinguish between instructions and the actual response.

3. If you're using a pre-built chatbot framework or library, check the documentation for any known issues related to context memory resizing and output formatting. There might be a specific way to handle instructions within the framework that you need to follow.

4. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the chatbot framework's support or community forums for assistance. They may have encountered similar issues and can provide guidance on how to resolve the problem.

The issue you're experiencing with your chatbot outputting "### Instruction: <all of its instructions>" after resizing its context memory suggests a problem with how it handles memory updates. Here are some potential causes and solutions:

### Causes:

1. **Context Memory Overwrite**: When the chatbot resizes its context memory, it might overwrite existing instructions or data. This could lead to the display of all instructions.

2. **Incorrect Memory Management**: Poor memory management can cause the chatbot to lose track of its current state or instructions.

3. **Logic Loop or Infinite Recursion**: A logic loop or infinite recursion might occur when the chatbot resizes its context memory, leading to the repetition of instructions.

4. **Data Corruption**: Corruption of data within the context memory could result in the display of all instructions.

### Solutions:

#### 1. **Review Memory Management**

- **Check Memory Allocation**: Ensure that memory is allocated correctly and efficiently.
- **Implement Memory Deallocation**: Properly deallocate memory when it's no longer needed.

#### 2. **Debug Logic**

- **Identify Loops**: Look for potential loops in the code and correct them.
- **Check Recursion**: Ensure that recursive functions are properly implemented to avoid infinite recursion.

#### 3. **Validate Data**

- **Data Integrity Checks**: Implement checks to ensure data integrity within the context memory.

#### 4. **Context Memory Reset**

- **Reset Context**: Consider resetting the context memory after resizing to ensure a clean slate.

#### 5. **Logging and Debugging**

- **Enable Logging**: Turn on logging to track the chatbot's actions and identify the source of the issue.
- **Debugging Tools**: Utilize debugging tools to step through the code and understand the flow.

### Example Use Case:

```python
# Example of a chatbot with a context memory reset
class ChatBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context_memory = {}

    def resize_context(self):
        # Reset context memory
        self.context_memory = {}

    def process_instruction(self, instruction):
        # Process instruction
        self.context_memory[instruction] = "Processed"

    def get_instructions(self):
        # Return all instructions
        return self.context_memory

# Usage
chatbot = ChatBot()
chatbot.process_instruction("Instruction 1")
chatbot.process_instruction("Instruction 2")

# Reset context memory
chatbot.resize_context()

# Get instructions
print(chatbot.get_instructions())
```

In this example, the `resize_context` method resets the context memory, ensuring that the chatbot starts with a clean slate after resizing.
