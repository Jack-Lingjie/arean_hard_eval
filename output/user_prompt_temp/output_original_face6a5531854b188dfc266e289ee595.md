Problem
A mother bought a set of 
�
N toys for her 
2
2 kids, Alice and Bob. She has already decided which toy goes to whom, however she has forgotten the monetary values of the toys. She only remembers that she ordered the toys in ascending order of their value. The prices are always non-negative.

A distribution is said to be fair when no matter what the actual values were, the difference between the values of the toys Alice got, and the toys Bob got, does not exceed the maximum value of any toy.

Formally, let 
�
�
v 
i
​
  be the value of 
�
i-th toy, and 
�
S be a binary string such that 
�
�
=

S 
i
​
 =1 if the toy is to be given to Alice, and 
�
�
=
0
S 
i
​
 =0 if the toy is to be given to Bob.
Then, the distribution represented by 
�
S is said to be fair if, for all possible arrays

Print YES if the given distribution is fair, and NO otherwise.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer

T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer

N, the number of toys.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string

N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: YES or NO depending on whether 
�
S represents a fair distribution or not.

Each character of the output may be printed in either lowercase or uppercase, i.e, the strings NO, no, nO, and No will all be treated as equivalent.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Here is a short C program for the given problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int T, N, i;
    char S[1005];
    scanf("%d", &T);
    while (T--) {
        scanf("%d", &N);
        scanf("%s", S);
        int alice = 0, bob = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (S[i] == '1') {
                if (i % 2 == 0) alice++;
                else bob++;
            }
        }
        if (alice == bob || alice == bob + 1) printf("YES\n");
        else printf("NO\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of toys and the binary string representing the distribution. It then counts the number of toys assigned to Alice and Bob, and checks if the distribution is fair according to the given conditions. If the distribution is fair, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

**Fair Toy Distribution**

### Problem Description

A mother bought a set of `N` toys for her two kids, Alice and Bob. She has forgotten the monetary values of the toys but remembers that they were ordered in ascending order. The prices are non-negative.

A distribution is considered fair if the difference between the values of the toys Alice got and the toys Bob got does not exceed the maximum value of any toy.

### Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_N 100

int main() {
    int t, n;
    char s[MAX_N];

    // Read the number of test cases
    scanf("%d", &t);

    while (t--) {
        // Read the number of toys and the distribution string
        scanf("%d %s", &n, s);

        // Initialize variables
        int max_diff = 0;
        int alice_sum = 0;
        int bob_sum = 0;

        // Iterate over the distribution string
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Update the sums
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                alice_sum += 1;
            } else {
                bob_sum += 1;
            }

            // Update the maximum difference
            max_diff = (i < n - 1) ? max_diff : 0;
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                max_diff = (max_diff > alice_sum - bob_sum) ? max_diff : alice_sum - bob_sum;
            } else {
                max_diff = (max_diff > bob_sum - alice_sum) ? max_diff : bob_sum - alice_sum;
            }
        }

        // Check if the distribution is fair
        if (max_diff <= (s[n - 1] - '0')) {
            printf("YES\n");
        } else {
            printf("NO\n");
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1.  Read the number of test cases.
2.  For each test case:
    *   Read the number of toys and the distribution string.
    *   Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum difference and the sums of toys for Alice and Bob.
    *   Iterate over the distribution string:
        *   Update the sums based on the current character.
        *   Update the maximum difference.
    *   Check if the distribution is fair by comparing the maximum difference with the maximum value of any toy.
