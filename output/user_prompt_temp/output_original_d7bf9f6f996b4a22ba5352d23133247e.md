write me the best prompt structure to give an ai but give it to me in a way that I can relay to an ai as instructions. its not the full prompt to give it but like a frame work of how a prompt structure should be

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
When instructing an AI, use a clear and concise prompt structure that includes the following elements:

1. Context: Begin by providing a brief context or background information to set the stage for the AI's response. This helps the AI understand the purpose and scope of the task.

2. Task: Clearly state the specific task or question you want the AI to perform or answer. Make sure it is unambiguous and easy to understand.

3. Format: Specify the desired format or structure of the AI's response. This can include the length, style, or any other formatting requirements.

4. Constraints: If there are any limitations or constraints the AI should consider while generating the response, mention them explicitly.

5. Examples (optional): Provide one or more examples of the desired output to give the AI a better understanding of your expectations.

Here's a template you can use to relay instructions to an AI:

"Context: [Provide context or background information]
Task: [State the specific task or question]
Format: [Specify the desired format or structure]
Constraints: [Mention any limitations or constraints]
Examples (optional): [Provide examples of desired output]"

Remember to replace the bracketed sections with your specific instructions.

**Optimizing AI Prompt Structure**

To craft effective prompts for AI models, follow this framework:

### 1. **Clear Objective**

- **Define the Task**: Clearly state what you want the AI to achieve.
- **Provide Context**: Offer relevant background information.

### 2. **Specific Requirements**

- **Detail the Output**: Specify the format and content of the expected response.
- **Include Constraints**: Mention any limitations or restrictions.

### 3. **Relevant Information**

- **Provide Necessary Data**: Include any relevant data or examples.
- **Explain Key Concepts**: Clarify any complex terms or ideas.

### 4. **Evaluation Criteria**

- **Define Success**: Clearly outline what constitutes a successful response.
- **Specify Evaluation Metrics**: Mention how the response will be evaluated.

### 5. **Additional Guidance**

- **Offer Examples**: Provide examples to illustrate the task.
- **Clarify Ambiguities**: Address any potential ambiguities.

### Example

**Prompt Structure Example**

- **Task**: Write a short story about a character who learns a new skill.
- **Context**: The story should be set in a futuristic city.
- **Output**: The story should be exactly 250 words long.
- **Constraints**: The story should include a character who is initially hesitant but eventually enthusiastic about learning.
- **Data**: Include a character named "Ava" who is a skilled engineer.
- **Key Concepts**: Explain the concept of "neuroplasticity" and how it applies to learning.
- **Success**: The story should be engaging and convey the importance of perseverance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The story will be evaluated based on its creativity and coherence.
- **Examples**: Provide examples of stories that successfully convey the importance of learning.
- **Ambiguities**: Clarify any potential ambiguities in the task.

This framework helps ensure that your prompts are clear, concise, and effective in guiding the AI's response.
