write a python program to calculate max number of continuous zeroes surrounded by 1s in a binary string

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Here's a Python program that calculates the maximum number of continuous zeroes surrounded by 1s in a binary string:

```python
def max_continuous_zeroes(binary_string):
    max_zeroes = 0
    current_zeroes = 0
    prev_one = False

    for char in binary_string:
        if char == '0' and prev_one:
            current_zeroes += 1
        elif char == '1':
            if prev_one:
                max_zeroes = max(max_zeroes, current_zeroes)
                current_zeroes = 0
            prev_one = True
        else:
            prev_one = False

    return max_zeroes

binary_string = input("Enter a binary string: ")
result = max_continuous_zeroes(binary_string)
print("Max number of continuous zeroes surrounded by 1s:", result)
```

You can run this program, enter a binary string, and it will output the maximum number of continuous zeroes surrounded by 1s.

**Calculating Max Continuous Zeroes in a Binary String**

The following Python program calculates the maximum number of continuous zeroes surrounded by ones in a binary string.

### Code

```python
def max_continuous_zeroes(binary_string):
    """
    Calculate the maximum number of continuous zeroes surrounded by ones.

    Args:
        binary_string (str): A string consisting of binary digits (0s and 1s).

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of continuous zeroes.
    """

    # Initialize variables to track the maximum and current continuous zeroes
    max_zeroes = 0
    current_zeroes = 0

    # Iterate over each character in the binary string
    for char in binary_string:
        # If the character is '0', increment the current continuous zeroes
        if char == '0':
            current_zeroes += 1
            # Update the maximum continuous zeroes if necessary
            max_zeroes = max(max_zeroes, current_zeroes)
        # If the character is '1', reset the current continuous zeroes
        else:
            current_zeroes = 0

    return max_zeroes

# Example usage:
binary_string = "110100001100"
max_zeroes = max_continuous_zeroes(binary_string)
print(f"Maximum continuous zeroes: {max_zeroes}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Definition**: The `max_continuous_zeroes` function takes a binary string as input and returns the maximum number of continuous zeroes.

2. **Initialization**: Initialize `max_zeroes` to store the maximum number of continuous zeroes found so far and `current_zeroes` to track the current number of continuous zeroes.

3. **Iteration**: Iterate over each character in the binary string.

4. **Handling Zeroes**: If the character is '0', increment `current_zeroes` and update `max_zeroes` if `current_zeroes` is greater.

5. **Handling Ones**: If the character is '1', reset `current_zeroes` to 0.

6. **Return**: Return `max_zeroes` after iterating over the entire string.

### Example Use Case

The example usage demonstrates how to use the `max_continuous_zeroes` function with a binary string. It prints the maximum number of continuous zeroes found in the string.
