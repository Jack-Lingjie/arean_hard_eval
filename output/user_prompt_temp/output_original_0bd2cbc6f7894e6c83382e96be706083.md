Given problem: Spill removal after chroma-key processing. The input is an image with an alpha channel. The transparency was achieved with simple binary chroma-keying, e.g. a pixel is either fully transparent or fully opaque. Now the input image contains spill from the chroma color. Describe an algorithm that can do spill removal for arbitrary chroma colors. The chroma color is known. Describe in enough detail to make it implementable.

Algorithm for Spill Removal after Chroma-Key Processing:

1. Input:
   - Image with an alpha channel (RGBA format)
   - Chroma color (Rc, Gc, Bc)

2. Initialize a new empty image with the same dimensions as the input image.

3. Loop through each pixel in the input image:
   a. For each pixel (i, j), extract its color and alpha values (R, G, B, A).
   b. If the alpha value (A) is fully transparent (A = 0), copy the pixel color (R, G, B, A) to the corresponding position in the new image.
   c. If the alpha value (A) is fully opaque (A = 255), perform the following steps:

      i. Calculate the spill ratio for each color channel:
         - Red spill ratio (Rs) = max(0, (R - Rc) / (255 - Rc))
         - Green spill ratio (Gs) = max(0, (G - Gc) / (255 - Gc))
         - Blue spill ratio (Bs) = max(0, (B - Bc) / (255 - Bc))

      ii. Calculate the spill suppression factor (SSF) as the minimum of the spill ratios:
         - SSF = min(Rs, Gs, Bs)

      iii. Calculate the new color values by suppressing the spill:
         - New red value (Rn) = R - SSF * (R - Rc)
         - New green value (Gn) = G - SSF * (G - Gc)
         - New blue value (Bn) = B - SSF * (B - Bc)

      iv. Copy the new color values (Rn, Gn, Bn, A) to the corresponding position in the new image.

4. Return the new image with the spill removed.

This algorithm can be implemented in any programming language that supports image processing, such as Python with the PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV. The algorithm works for arbitrary chroma colors by taking the chroma color as an input and using it to calculate the spill ratios and suppression factor.

**Spill Removal Algorithm**

### Problem Description

After chroma-key processing, the input image contains spill from the chroma color. This algorithm aims to remove the spill for arbitrary chroma colors.

### Algorithm Overview

The spill removal algorithm involves the following steps:

1. **Thresholding**: Separate the chroma color from the rest of the image.
2. **Spill Detection**: Identify areas where the chroma color is present but should not be.
3. **Boundary Detection**: Find the boundaries between the chroma color and the rest of the image.
4. **Spill Removal**: Gradually reduce the intensity of the chroma color within the detected boundaries.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm

#### **Thresholding**

- **Step 1**: Convert the input image to the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space.
- **Step 2**: Set a threshold for the hue value to isolate the chroma color.

#### **Spill Detection**

- **Step 3**: Identify areas where the chroma color is present but should not be. This is typically done by:
  - **Step 3.1**: Applying a threshold to the saturation value to filter out areas with low saturation.
  - **Step 3.2**: Using morphological operations (e.g., dilation and erosion) to refine the detection.

#### **Boundary Detection**

- **Step 4**: Find the boundaries between the chroma color and the rest of the image. This can be achieved by:
  - **Step 4.1**: Applying the Sobel operator to detect edges.
  - **Step 4.2**: Refining the edges using morphological operations.

#### **Spill Removal**

- **Step 5**: Gradually reduce the intensity of the chroma color within the detected boundaries. This can be done by:
  - **Step 5.1**: Applying a gradient filter to reduce the intensity.
  - **Step 5.2**: Adjusting the saturation value to minimize the spill.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have an image with a chroma color of blue. The algorithm would:

1. **Thresholding**: Convert the image to HSV and set the hue threshold to isolate blue pixels.
2. **Spill Detection**: Apply a saturation threshold and morphological operations to detect areas with blue pixels that should not be.
3. **Boundary Detection**: Use the Sobel operator and morphological operations to find the boundaries between blue pixels and the rest of the image.
4. **Spill Removal**: Apply a gradient filter and adjust the saturation value to minimize the blue spill.

### Code Implementation

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def spill_removal(image_path, chroma_color):
    # Load the image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)

    # Convert to HSV
    hsv_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

    # Thresholding
    lower_chroma = np.array([chroma_color[0] - 10, 100, 100])
    upper_chroma = np.array([chroma_color[0] + 10, 255, 255])
    thresholded_image = cv2.inRange(hsv_image, lower_chroma, upper_chroma)

    # Spill Detection
    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)
    dilated_image = cv2.dilate(thresholded_image, kernel, iterations=2)
    eroded_image = cv2.erode(dilated_image, kernel, iterations=1)

    # Boundary Detection
    grad_x = cv2.Sobel(eroded_image, cv2.CV_8U, 1, 0, ksize=3)
    grad_y = cv2.Sobel(eroded_image, cv2.CV_8U, 0, 1, ksize=3)
    edges = cv2.bitwise_or(grad_x, grad_y)

    # Spill Removal
    reduced_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)
    result = cv2.addWeighted(image, 1, reduced_image, 0.5, 0)

    return result

# Example usage
image_path = "input_image.jpg"
chroma_color = (120, 255, 255)  # Blue color in HSV
result = spill_removal(image_path, chroma_color)
cv2.imwrite("output_image.jpg", result)
```

This code implements the spill removal algorithm using OpenCV and NumPy. It takes an image path and a chroma color as input and returns the processed image. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a blue chroma color.
