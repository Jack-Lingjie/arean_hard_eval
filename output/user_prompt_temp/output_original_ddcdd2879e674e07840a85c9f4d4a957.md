<|User Prompt|>
We run a peer support mobile application with 24 by 7 group chats open. We have a team of peer moderators that monitor and engage with members on the app. I want to create a project document to track the epic - Use NLP/Smarter Alerts to improve peer efficiency with the idea that we can use AI to raise alerts for things like here's a message that is very negative in sentiment or here's a new user posting for the first time or here's an unanswered question. I also want to define tangible metrics that we can use to track project success

Title: Use NLP/Smarter Alerts to Improve Peer Efficiency

Project Objective:
To implement an AI-driven NLP system that raises alerts for specific scenarios in the peer support mobile application, such as negative sentiment messages, new user posts, and unanswered questions. This will improve the efficiency of peer moderators and enhance user experience.

Scope:
1. Develop an NLP model to analyze and categorize messages based on sentiment, user status, and question status.
2. Integrate the NLP model with the mobile application to raise alerts for peer moderators.
3. Train the model to improve its accuracy and adapt to the specific needs of the peer support community.
4. Monitor and evaluate the impact of the NLP system on moderator efficiency and user satisfaction.

Project Milestones:
1. Research and select an appropriate NLP framework or library.
2. Develop a prototype NLP model to analyze and categorize messages.
3. Test the prototype model with sample data and refine its accuracy.
4. Integrate the NLP model with the mobile application.
5. Train the model using real-world data from the peer support community.
6. Deploy the NLP system and monitor its performance.
7. Evaluate the impact of the NLP system on moderator efficiency and user satisfaction.

Tangible Metrics for Project Success:
1. Reduction in response time: Measure the average time taken by moderators to respond to messages before and after implementing the NLP system. Aim for a significant reduction in response time.
2. Increase in moderator efficiency: Track the number of messages handled by each moderator before and after implementing the NLP system. Aim for an increase in the number of messages handled per moderator.
3. Improvement in user satisfaction: Conduct user surveys to gauge satisfaction levels before and after implementing the NLP system. Aim for an increase in user satisfaction scores.
4. Reduction in missed messages: Measure the number of unanswered questions or unaddressed negative sentiment messages before and after implementing the NLP system. Aim for a significant reduction in missed messages.
5. Accuracy of the NLP model: Monitor the accuracy of the NLP model in categorizing messages and raising alerts. Aim for a high accuracy rate to ensure the effectiveness of the system.

Project Team:
1. Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing the project, coordinating with team members, and ensuring timely completion of milestones.
2. NLP Developer: Responsible for researching, developing, and refining the NLP model.
3. Mobile App Developer: Responsible for integrating the NLP model with the mobile application.
4. Data Analyst: Responsible for training the NLP model using real-world data and monitoring its performance.
5. Peer Moderator Lead: Responsible for providing feedback on the NLP system and coordinating with the project team to ensure its effectiveness in improving moderator efficiency.
