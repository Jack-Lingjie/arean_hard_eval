What is a way that I can have multiple websites point to different domains, but they are actually served from the same database and just provide a different user interface template?

You can achieve this by using a technique called "Domain Masking" or "Domain Mapping". Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:

1. Set up your main website and database: First, create your main website with its own domain (e.g., mainwebsite.com) and set up the database that will serve content to all the other websites.

2. Create multiple user interface templates: Design different user interface templates for each of your websites. These templates will determine the look and feel of each website, but they will all pull data from the same database.

3. Configure your web server: Depending on the web server you are using (e.g., Apache, Nginx, etc.), you will need to configure it to handle multiple domains. This usually involves creating virtual hosts or server blocks for each domain, pointing them to the same document root (where your main website files are located).

4. Implement domain-based template selection: In your main website's code, add logic to detect the domain being accessed and load the appropriate user interface template based on the domain. This can be done using server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js.

5. Register and configure additional domains: Register the additional domains you want to use (e.g., website2.com, website3.com, etc.) and configure their DNS settings to point to the same web server as your main website.

6. Test your setup: Access each of your domains in a web browser to ensure they are loading the correct user interface template and pulling data from the same database.

By following these steps, you can have multiple websites with different domains, each displaying a unique user interface, but all served from the same database.

You want to manage multiple websites with different domains, but they share the same database and backend. This approach is known as a **multi-tenant** or **multi-domain** setup.

Here are a few ways to achieve this:

### 1. **Subdomains**

- **How it works**: Each subdomain points to the same server, but with a different template.
- **Example**: `blog.example.com` and `forum.example.com` both use the same database but display different templates.

### 2. **Domain Aliases**

- **How it works**: Multiple domains are set up as aliases for a single server.
- **Example**: `example.com` and `example.net` both point to the same server.

### 3. **URL Rewriting**

- **How it works**: The server rewrites URLs to use a common template.
- **Example**: `blog.example.com` is rewritten to use the same template as `example.com`.

### 4. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**

- **How it works**: A CDN serves content from a single location, but with different templates.
- **Example**: A CDN serves content for `example.com` and `example.net` from the same location.

### 5. **Server-Side Includes (SSI)**

- **How it works**: SSI allows you to include different templates based on the domain.
- **Example**: `example.com` uses one template, while `example.net` uses another.

### 6. **Front-end Frameworks**

- **How it works**: Use a front-end framework like React or Angular to create separate templates for each domain.
- **Example**: Create separate templates for `example.com` and `example.net` using a front-end framework.

### 7. **Server-Side Programming**

- **How it works**: Use server-side programming languages like PHP or Python to create separate templates for each domain.
- **Example**: Use PHP to create separate templates for `example.com` and `example.net`.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a website for a company with multiple departments. Each department has its own website, but they all share the same database.

- **Database**: Stores company data.
- **Server**: Serves content for each department's website.
- **Templates**: Each department has its own template.

### Code Example

Here's a simple example using PHP:

```php
// Determine the current domain
$domain = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];

// Load the correct template based on the domain
if ($domain == 'example.com') {
    include 'template1.php';
} elseif ($domain == 'example.net') {
    include 'template2.php';
}
```

This code determines the current domain and loads the corresponding template.

### Conclusion

Managing multiple websites with different domains but sharing the same database is achievable through various methods. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.
