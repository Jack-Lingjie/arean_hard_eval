write me a python script that will make a DVD screen saver logo bounce around and every time it touches the corner of the screen it will tally a point and display the points on screen

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Creating a full Python script for a DVD screensaver with a bouncing logo and point tally requires a few libraries and some code. Here's a script using the Pygame library:

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600

# Colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

# Create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("DVD Screensaver")

# Load the DVD logo
dvd_logo = pygame.image.load("dvd_logo.png")
logo_rect = dvd_logo.get_rect()

# Set the initial position and speed
logo_rect.x = random.randint(0, WIDTH - logo_rect.width)
logo_rect.y = random.randint(0, HEIGHT - logo_rect.height)
speed_x = random.choice([-3, 3])
speed_y = random.choice([-3, 3])

# Set up the font
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)

# Initialize the point tally
points = 0

# Main loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Move the logo
    logo_rect.x += speed_x
    logo_rect.y += speed_y

    # Check for collisions with the screen edges
    if logo_rect.left <= 0 or logo_rect.right >= WIDTH:
        speed_x = -speed_x
        if logo_rect.left <= 0:
            logo_rect.left = 0
        else:
            logo_rect.right = WIDTH

    if logo_rect.top <= 0 or logo_rect.bottom >= HEIGHT:
        speed_y = -speed_y
        if logo_rect.top <= 0:
            logo_rect.top = 0
        else:
            logo_rect.bottom = HEIGHT

    # Check for corner collisions and update the point tally
    if (logo_rect.left == 0 or logo_rect.right == WIDTH) and (logo_rect.top == 0 or logo_rect.bottom == HEIGHT):
        points += 1

    # Draw everything
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    screen.blit(dvd_logo, logo_rect)

    # Draw the point tally
    point_text = font.render(f"Points: {points}", True, WHITE)
    screen.blit(point_text, (10, 10))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()
    pygame.time.delay(10)

# Quit Pygame
pygame.quit()
```

Before running the script, make sure you have the Pygame library installed:

```
pip install pygame
```

Also, save a DVD logo image as "dvd_logo.png" in the same directory as the script. The script will create a window with the DVD logo bouncing around, and it will display the point tally in the top-left corner of the screen.

**DVD Screen Saver Logo Bouncer**

This script creates a bouncing DVD logo that increments a score each time it touches a screen corner.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

### Code

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600

# Set up display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

# DVD logo image
DVD_LOGO = pygame.Surface((50, 50))
DVD_LOGO.fill((255, 0, 0))  # Red color

# Initial logo position
logo_x = SCREEN_WIDTH // 2
logo_y = SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2

# Initial velocity
velocity_x = 3
velocity_y = 3

# Score
score = 0

# Game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    # Fill screen with black
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))

    # Draw DVD logo
    screen.blit(DVD_LOGO, (logo_x, logo_y))

    # Update logo position
    logo_x += velocity_x
    logo_y += velocity_y

    # Bounce off edges
    if logo_x < 0 or logo_x > SCREEN_WIDTH - DVD_LOGO.get_width():
        velocity_x *= -1
        score += 1
    if logo_y < 0 or logo_y > SCREEN_HEIGHT - DVD_LOGO.get_height():
        velocity_y *= -1
        score += 1

    # Display score
    font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
    text = font.render(f"Score: {score}", True, (255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(text, (10, 10))

    # Update display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap framerate
    pygame.time.Clock().tick(60)
```

### Explanation

- This script initializes Pygame and sets up a window with a black background.
- It loads a red square as the DVD logo.
- The logo starts at the center of the screen with a velocity.
- The game loop continuously updates the logo's position, checks for collisions with the screen edges, and increments the score when a corner is touched.
- The score is displayed at the top-left corner of the screen.

### Running the Script

1. Install the required `pygame` library using pip: `pip install pygame`
2. Save this script as `dvd_screensaver.py`
3. Run the script using Python: `python dvd_screensaver.py`

This will launch the DVD screen saver logo bouncer.
