<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
A medical description of an inflamed joint involves the swelling, redness, warmth, and pain in a joint due to the body's immune response to an injury or infection. This condition is also known as arthritis or arthralgia.

Presentation:
An inflamed joint typically presents with the following signs and symptoms:
1. Swelling: The joint may appear larger than usual due to the accumulation of fluid or inflammation of the surrounding tissues.
2. Redness: The skin over the joint may appear red or flushed due to increased blood flow to the area.
3. Warmth: The joint may feel warm to the touch, again due to increased blood flow.
4. Pain: The patient may experience pain in the joint, which can range from mild to severe and may worsen with movement or pressure.
5. Stiffness: The joint may feel stiff and difficult to move, especially after periods of inactivity.
6. Decreased range of motion: The patient may have difficulty moving the joint through its full range of motion due to pain and swelling.

Emergency referral criteria:
An inflamed joint may require emergency medical attention if any of the following criteria are met:
1. Severe pain that is not relieved by over-the-counter pain medications.
2. Sudden onset of joint swelling, redness, and warmth, especially if accompanied by fever or chills, which may indicate an infection.
3. Inability to move the joint or bear weight on it.
4. Signs of poor blood circulation, such as cold, pale, or blue skin around the joint.
5. A history of recent trauma or injury to the joint.
6. Presence of an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes or a weakened immune system, that may increase the risk of complications.

Common causes:
Inflamed joints can be caused by various factors, including:
1. Osteoarthritis: The most common form of arthritis, caused by the wear and tear of joint cartilage over time.
2. Rheumatoid arthritis: An autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of the joints, causing inflammation.
3. Gout: A form of arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain.
4. Infections: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections can cause joint inflammation, such as septic arthritis or Lyme disease.
5. Injury or trauma: Injuries to the joint, such as sprains, strains, or fractures, can cause inflammation and swelling.
6. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): An autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation in various parts of the body, including the joints.
7. Psoriatic arthritis: A form of arthritis that affects some people with the skin condition psoriasis, causing joint inflammation and other symptoms.
