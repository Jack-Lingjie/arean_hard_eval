Technical details of GDDR6 and GDDR7, no qualitative info, only precise details. Include Memory Bandwidth example calculations for 2500MHz with both technologies.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
GDDR6 (Graphics Double Data Rate 6) and GDDR7 (Graphics Double Data Rate 7) are types of synchronous graphics random-access memory (SGRAM) with a high bandwidth interface designed for use in graphics cards, game consoles, and high-performance computing applications.

GDDR6:

1. Standard memory clock speeds: 14 Gbps to 21 Gbps
2. Memory bus width: 32-bit, 64-bit, or 128-bit
3. Voltage: 1.35V
4. Prefetch: 2n (double data rate)
5. Memory Bandwidth: Up to 672 GB/s (for 384-bit interface and 21 Gbps data rate)

GDDR7:

As of now, GDDR7 is not yet released, and there is limited information available about its technical specifications. However, it is expected to offer higher memory clock speeds, improved power efficiency, and increased memory bandwidth compared to GDDR6.

Memory Bandwidth example calculations for 2500MHz with both technologies:

GDDR6:

Memory Clock Speed: 2500 MHz
Data Rate: 2 (double data rate) * 2500 MHz = 5000 MT/s (Mega Transfers per second)
Bus Width: 256-bit (assuming a typical bus width for graphics cards)
Memory Bandwidth: (5000 MT/s * 256-bit) / 8 = 1600000 / 8 = 200000 MB/s or 200 GB/s

GDDR7:

Since GDDR7 is not yet released, we cannot provide precise calculations for memory bandwidth. However, it is expected to have a higher data rate and improved memory bandwidth compared to GDDR6.

**Memory Bandwidth Example Calculations**

### For GDDR6 at 2500 MHz

- **Data Rate**: 14 Gbps
- **Clock Speed**: 2500 MHz
- **Bandwidth Calculation**:
  - **Bandwidth = Data Rate \* Number of Channels**
  - **Bandwidth = 14 Gbps \* 8 (assuming 8-bit channels)**
  - **Bandwidth = 112 GB/s**

### For GDDR7 at 2500 MHz

- **Data Rate**: 16 Gbps
- **Clock Speed**: 2500 MHz
- **Bandwidth Calculation**:
  - **Bandwidth = Data Rate \* Number of Channels**
  - **Bandwidth = 16 Gbps \* 8 (assuming 8-bit channels)**
  - **Bandwidth = 128 GB/s**
