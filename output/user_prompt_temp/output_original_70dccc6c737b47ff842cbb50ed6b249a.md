Hello, what do you think of this arduino code in regards to understandability, optimization and size?
Any suggestions for improvements?

void cycleLEDs(int interval) {
  const int nOutPins = sizeof(outPins) / sizeof(outPins[0]);
  static unsigned long lastChange = 0;
  static int currIndex = 0; // Use static to retain value between function calls
  int nextIndex = 0;
  
  if (millis() >= lastChange + abs(interval)) {

    // Determine direction
    int direction = interval < 0 ? -1 : 1;

    // Update secondary index
    nextIndex = currIndex + direction;
    if (nextIndex < 0) {
      nextIndex = nOutPins - 1;
    } else if (nextIndex >= nOutPins) {
      nextIndex = 0;
    }
    
    // Turn off all LEDs
    for (int i = 0; i < nOutPins; i++) {
      if (i == currIndex || i == nextIndex){
        digitalWrite(outPins[i], HIGH);
      } else {
        digitalWrite(outPins[i], LOW);
      }      
    }

    // Update current index
    currIndex += direction;
    if (currIndex < 0) {
      currIndex = nOutPins - 1;
    } else if (currIndex >= nOutPins) {
      currIndex = 0;
    }

    // Update timer
    lastChange = millis();
  }
}

Thank you for your help, i value your input.

Hello! Your Arduino code looks quite good in terms of understandability and size. However, there are a few suggestions I can make to improve it further:

1. You can remove the `nextIndex` variable and directly update the `currIndex` variable. This will save some memory and make the code more concise.

2. You can use the modulo operator (`%`) to wrap around the index values, which will simplify the code.

3. You can use a single loop to turn off all LEDs except the current one.

Here's the modified version of your code:

```cpp
void cycleLEDs(int interval) {
  const int nOutPins = sizeof(outPins) / sizeof(outPins[0]);
  static unsigned long lastChange = 0;
  static int currIndex = 0; // Use static to retain value between function calls
  
  if (millis() >= lastChange + abs(interval)) {

    // Determine direction
    int direction = interval < 0 ? -1 : 1;

    // Turn off all LEDs except the current one
    for (int i = 0; i < nOutPins; i++) {
      digitalWrite(outPins[i], (i == currIndex) ? HIGH : LOW);
    }

    // Update current index
    currIndex = (currIndex + direction + nOutPins) % nOutPins;

    // Update timer
    lastChange = millis();
  }
}
```

This modified version should be more optimized and easier to understand. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

**Code Review**

The provided Arduino code, `cycleLEDs`, is generally well-structured. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance understandability, optimization, and size.

### Understandability

- **Variable Naming**: Variable names like `nOutPins` and `outPins` are clear. However, `currIndex` and `nextIndex` could be more descriptive.

- **Comments**: While the code has some comments, they are sparse. Adding more comments would improve readability.

### Optimization

- **Redundant Checks**: The conditions `if (nextIndex < 0)` and `if (nextIndex >= nOutPins)` are redundant. The same logic is applied in the `currIndex` update.

- **Direction Calculation**: The `direction` variable is calculated unnecessarily. It can be directly used in the `nextIndex` calculation.

### Size

- **Function Size**: The function is relatively large. Consider breaking it down into smaller functions for better maintainability.

### Suggestions

```cpp
/**
 * Cycle LEDs at a specified interval.
 *
 * @param interval The interval in milliseconds.
 */
void cycleLEDs(int interval) {
  const int nOutPins = sizeof(outPins) / sizeof(outPins[0]);
  static unsigned long lastChange = 0;
  static int currentIndex = 0; // Use static to retain value between function calls

  if (millis() - lastChange >= abs(interval)) {
    // Determine direction
    int direction = interval < 0 ? -1 : 1;

    // Update secondary index
    int nextIndex = (currentIndex + direction + nOutPins) % nOutPins;

    // Turn off all LEDs
    for (int i = 0; i < nOutPins; i++) {
      if (i == currentIndex || i == nextIndex) {
        digitalWrite(outPins[i], HIGH);
      } else {
        digitalWrite(outPins[i], LOW);
      }
    }

    // Update current index
    currentIndex = nextIndex;

    // Update timer
    lastChange = millis();
  }
}
```

### Key Changes

- Simplified the `nextIndex` calculation.
- Removed redundant checks.
- Improved variable naming.
- Added a brief description of the function.

### Additional Advice

- Consider using a more efficient method to update the LEDs, such as using a single `digitalWrite` call for all LEDs at once.
- If the `outPins` array is not modified elsewhere in the code, consider making it a `const` array.
- Use a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
