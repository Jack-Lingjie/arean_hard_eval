I have function func1 which creates a bytesio object and passes to func2. func2 writes to the bytesio object but never returns it. How to mock func2 when unit testing func1.

To mock `func2` when unit testing `func1`, you can use the `unittest.mock` library in Python. Here's an example of how you can do this:

1. Import the necessary libraries and modules:

```python
import io
from unittest import TestCase
from unittest.mock import patch
```

2. Define your functions `func1` and `func2`:

```python
def func1():
    buffer = io.BytesIO()
    func2(buffer)
    # Do something with the buffer
    return buffer.getvalue()

def func2(buffer):
    # Write something to the buffer
    buffer.write(b"Hello, World!")
```

3. Create a test class for `func1` and use the `patch` decorator to mock `func2`:

```python
class TestFunc1(TestCase):
    @patch("your_module.func2")
    def test_func1(self, mock_func2):
        # Set up the mock for func2
        def side_effect(buffer):
            buffer.write(b"Mocked data")
        mock_func2.side_effect = side_effect

        # Call func1 and check the result
        result = func1()
        self.assertEqual(result, b"Mocked data")

        # Check if func2 was called with the correct argument
        mock_func2.assert_called_once()
        self.assertIsInstance(mock_func2.call_args[0][0], io.BytesIO)
```

Replace `your_module` with the name of the module where `func1` and `func2` are defined.

This test case will mock `func2` so that it writes "Mocked data" to the `BytesIO` object instead of its original behavior. The test will then call `func1` and check if the result is equal to the mocked data. It also checks if `func2` was called with a `BytesIO` object as its argument.

**Mocking `func2` in Unit Testing**

When testing `func1`, you want to mock `func2` to isolate its behavior. Since `func2` writes to a `BytesIO` object but doesn't return it, you'll need to use a mocking library to control its behavior.

### Using `unittest.mock`

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from io import BytesIO

def func1():
    """Creates a BytesIO object and passes it to func2."""
    bio = BytesIO()
    func2(bio)
    return bio  # This line is not executed in the original code

def func2(bio):
    """Writes to the BytesIO object."""
    bio.write(b"Hello, World!")

class TestFunc1(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('func2')
    def test_func1(self, mock_func2):
        """Test func1 with a mocked func2."""
        # Create a BytesIO object
        bio = BytesIO()

        # Mock func2 to return None (since it doesn't return anything)
        mock_func2.return_value = None

        # Call func1
        result = func1()

        # Verify that func2 was called with the correct argument
        mock_func2.assert_called_once_with(bio)

        # Verify that the BytesIO object is not empty
        self.assertGreater(len(result.getvalue()), 0)
```

### Explanation

1. **`@patch('func2')`**: This decorator creates a mock object for `func2`.
2. **`mock_func2.return_value = None`**: Since `func2` doesn't return anything, we set its return value to `None`.
3. **`mock_func2.assert_called_once_with(bio)`**: Verify that `func2` was called with the correct argument (`bio`).
4. **`self.assertGreater(len(result.getvalue()), 0)`**: Ensure that the `BytesIO` object is not empty.

### Example Use Case

This mocking approach allows you to test `func1` independently of `func2`. You can modify the mock behavior to suit your testing needs.

**Remember**: Always use mocking libraries to isolate dependencies and make your tests more robust.
