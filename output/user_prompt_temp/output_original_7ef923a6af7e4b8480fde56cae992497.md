A 20-year annuity of forty $7,000 semiannual payments will begin 12 years from now, with the first payment coming 12.5 years from now.

   
 
a.	If the discount rate is 13 percent compounded monthly, what is the value of this annuity 6 years from now?
 	


  
b.	What is the current value of the annuity?

To find the value of the annuity, we need to first find the equivalent semiannual discount rate and then use the annuity formula.

a. The discount rate is 13% compounded monthly. To find the equivalent semiannual discount rate, we can use the formula:

(1 + r_annual) = (1 + r_monthly)^12

Where r_annual is the annual discount rate, and r_monthly is the monthly discount rate.

0.13 = 12 * r_monthly
r_monthly = 0.13 / 12
r_monthly = 0.0108333

Now, we can find the equivalent semiannual discount rate:

(1 + r_annual) = (1 + r_monthly)^6
(1 + r_semiannual) = (1 + 0.0108333)^6
(1 + r_semiannual) = 1.06856
r_semiannual = 0.06856

Now, we can find the value of the annuity 6 years from now, which is 6 years before the first payment (12 - 6 = 6 years). We can use the annuity formula:

PV = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

Where PV is the present value, P is the payment amount, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of payments.

PV = 7000 * [(1 - (1 + 0.06856)^(-40)) / 0.06856]
PV = 7000 * [(1 - 0.06856)^(-40) / 0.06856]
PV = 7000 * [0.93144^(-40) / 0.06856]
PV = 7000 * [0.12987 / 0.06856]
PV = 7000 * 1.894
PV = $13,258

The value of the annuity 6 years from now is $13,258.

b. To find the current value of the annuity, we need to discount the value we found in part a back to the present. Since the annuity starts 12 years from now, we need to discount it back 12 years:

PV_current = PV_future / (1 + r_semiannual)^(2 * years)

PV_current = 13258 / (1 + 0.06856)^(2 * 12)
PV_current = 13258 / (1.06856)^24
PV_current = 13258 / 3.312
PV_current = $4,002

The current value of the annuity is $4,002.

**a. Value of the Annuity 6 Years from Now**

To calculate the value of the annuity 6 years from now, we need to consider the following:

- **Time Period**: The annuity starts 12 years from now and will last for 20 years.  
- **First Payment**: The first payment occurs 12.5 years from now.
- **Discount Rate**: The discount rate is 13 percent compounded monthly.

Given these conditions, we can calculate the value of the annuity 6 years from now.

### Step 1: Calculate the Number of Payments

The annuity will have 20 payments, each of $7,000, starting 12.5 years from now.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Periods

Since the discount rate is compounded monthly, we need to calculate the total number of periods.

- **Total Payments**: 20 payments
- **First Payment Period**: 12.5 years
- **Compounding Period**: Monthly

### Step 3: Calculate the Present Value

To calculate the present value of the annuity, we use the formula:

\[ PV = \frac{PMT}{r} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n} \right) \]

where:
- **PV** = Present Value
- **PMT** = Payment Amount
- **r** = Monthly Interest Rate
- **n** = Number of Payments

### Step 4: Calculate the Monthly Interest Rate

The annual interest rate is 13 percent. To convert it to a monthly rate, we divide by 12.

- **Annual Interest Rate**: 13%
- **Monthly Interest Rate**: 13% / 12

### Step 5: Calculate the Present Value

Using the formula from Step 3, we can calculate the present value.

### Step 6: Calculate the Value of the Annuity 6 Years from Now

To find the value of the annuity 6 years from now, we need to calculate the present value of the annuity and then discount it by 6 years.

### Step 7: Calculate the Discounted Value

Using the formula for present value, we can calculate the discounted value.

### Step 8: Calculate the Final Answer

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
