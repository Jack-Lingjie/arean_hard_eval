1. Radiopharmaceuticals: Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is the most commonly used radioisotope in nuclear cardiology, with a half-life of 6 hours. It is used in SPECT imaging for myocardial perfusion studies.

2. Gated SPECT: Gated SPECT is a technique that synchronizes image acquisition with the patient's ECG, allowing for assessment of both myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function.

3. Stress Testing: Pharmacologic stress testing using adenosine, regadenoson, or dipyridamole is often used in patients who cannot exercise adequately. These agents cause coronary vasodilation, increasing blood flow to normal coronary arteries and revealing areas of reduced perfusion in ischemic regions.

4. Attenuation Correction: Soft tissue attenuation can lead to artifacts in nuclear cardiology images. Techniques such as prone imaging, dual-isotope imaging, and CT-based attenuation correction can help minimize these artifacts.

5. Radiotracer Redistribution: Thallium-201 (Tl-201) exhibits redistribution, meaning that it can move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration over time. This property allows for the detection of viable myocardium in ischemic regions.

6. Viability Assessment: Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) PET imaging can be used to assess myocardial viability by evaluating glucose metabolism in the myocardium.

7. Rubidium-82 (Rb-82) PET: Rb-82 is a generator-produced PET radiotracer with a short half-life of 75 seconds, allowing for rapid myocardial perfusion imaging.

8. Quantitative Perfusion Analysis: Quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion images can help improve diagnostic accuracy by providing objective measurements of perfusion defects and ischemic burden.

9. Normal Database Comparison: Comparing a patient's myocardial perfusion images to a normal database can help improve diagnostic accuracy by accounting for variations in normal myocardial uptake patterns.

10. Transient Ischemic Dilation (TID): TID is a marker of severe and extensive coronary artery disease, characterized by an increase in left ventricular cavity size during stress compared to rest imaging.

11. SPECT vs. PET: PET imaging has higher spatial and temporal resolution compared to SPECT, allowing for more accurate assessment of myocardial perfusion and function.

12. Radiation Safety: The ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle should be followed in nuclear cardiology to minimize radiation exposure to patients and staff.

13. Ventricular Dyssynchrony: Nuclear imaging can be used to assess ventricular dyssynchrony, which is a predictor of poor response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

14. Pretest Probability: The Diamond-Forrester classification can be used to estimate the pretest probability of coronary artery disease based on a patient's age, sex, and presenting symptoms.

15. Risk Stratification: Nuclear cardiology studies can help risk-stratify patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, guiding decisions regarding further testing and management.
