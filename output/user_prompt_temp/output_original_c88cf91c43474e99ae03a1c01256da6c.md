You are a DM running 5th Edition D&D. Before you begin your campaign, you want to bring some of the most powerful spells down to a more reasonable power level. Which spells do you change and how?

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
As a DM, it's important to maintain balance in your campaign to ensure a fun and challenging experience for your players. Here are some suggestions for modifying powerful spells in 5th Edition D&D:

1. Wish: Limit the scope of the spell by providing a list of specific effects that can be chosen, rather than allowing the player to request anything they desire. Additionally, you could increase the chance of never being able to cast Wish again after using it for a particularly powerful effect.

2. Meteor Swarm: Reduce the damage dealt by the spell, or limit the number of meteors that can be summoned. You could also increase the casting time, making it more difficult to use in combat situations.

3. Time Stop: Limit the number of rounds the caster can act freely during the time stop, or introduce a chance for the spell to fail or backfire, causing negative effects for the caster.

4. True Polymorph: Limit the range of creatures or objects that can be targeted by the spell, or introduce a chance for the transformation to be temporary or unstable, reverting back to the original form after a certain period of time or under specific conditions.

5. Power Word Kill: Increase the hit point threshold for the spell to take effect, or require the caster to make a successful spell attack roll against the target's AC in order for the spell to work.

6. Simulacrum: Limit the number of simulacra that can be created at one time, or introduce a chance for the simulacrum to become unstable and turn against the caster.

7. Gate: Limit the range of planes that can be accessed through the gate, or require the caster to have a specific key or knowledge of the destination plane in order to open the gate.

8. Shapechange: Limit the range of creatures that can be transformed into, or introduce a chance for the transformation to be temporary or unstable, reverting back to the original form after a certain period of time or under specific conditions.

9. Foresight: Reduce the duration of the spell, or limit the number of benefits granted by the spell (e.g., only advantage on attack rolls or saving throws, not both).

10. Prismatic Wall: Reduce the number of layers in the wall, or limit the effects of each layer to make it easier for characters to bypass the wall.

Remember, as a DM, you have the final say in how spells function in your campaign. It's important to communicate any changes to your players and ensure that they understand the reasoning behind the modifications.
