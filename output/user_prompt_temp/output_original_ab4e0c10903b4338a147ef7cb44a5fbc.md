count distinct values in a column given a constraint from another column using over clause in ssms

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To count distinct values in a column given a constraint from another column using the OVER() clause in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), you can use the following query structure:

```sql
SELECT
    ColumnToApplyConstraint,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ColumnToCountDistinctValues) OVER (PARTITION BY ColumnToApplyConstraint) AS DistinctCount
FROM
    YourTableName
WHERE
    ConstraintColumn = 'YourConstraintValue'
```

Replace `YourTableName`, `ColumnToApplyConstraint`, `ColumnToCountDistinctValues`, `ConstraintColumn`, and `YourConstraintValue` with the appropriate values for your specific use case.

Here's an example using a hypothetical table called `Orders`:

```sql
SELECT
    CustomerID,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ProductID) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS DistinctProductCount
FROM
    Orders
WHERE
    OrderStatus = 'Completed'
```

In this example, we're counting the distinct `ProductID` values for each `CustomerID`, but only considering rows where the `OrderStatus` is 'Completed'.

**Counting Distinct Values with a Constraint**

To count distinct values in a column `column_name` while applying a constraint from another column `constraint_column`, use the `OVER` clause in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). 

### Example Query

```sql
SELECT 
    constraint_column,
    column_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY constraint_column) AS distinct_count
FROM 
    your_table;
```

### Explanation

- **`constraint_column`**: The column that defines the constraint.
- **`column_name`**: The column for which you want to count distinct values.
- **`COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY constraint_column)`**:
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT column_name)`: Counts the distinct values in `column_name`.
  - `OVER (PARTITION BY constraint_column)`: Groups the result by the values in `constraint_column`.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a table named `orders` with columns `customer_id` and `product_name`. You want to count the distinct products ordered by each customer.

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS distinct_products
FROM 
    orders;
```

This query will return each customer's ID, the products they ordered, and the number of distinct products ordered by each customer.
