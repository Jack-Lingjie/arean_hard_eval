Hi, I need to learn Rust. I'm an experienced C/C++/C#/Java/ObjC coder with familiarity in Python and JS. I have read the basics of Rust but want to get down to writing code. walk me through making a simple substring-match CLI app, like baby's first grep except only string literals for now.

Great! I'll guide you through creating a simple CLI app in Rust that matches string literals. We'll use the `rustc` compiler directly for simplicity. Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can download it from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

1. Create a new file called `substring_match.rs`.

2. Open the file in your favorite text editor and start by importing the necessary modules:

```rust
use std::env;
use std::io::{self, BufRead};
```

3. Next, define the main function:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Get command line arguments
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    // Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
    if args.len() != 2 {
        eprintln!("Usage: {} <substring>", args[0]);
        std::process::exit(1);
    }

    // Get the substring to search for
    let substring = &args[1];

    // Read lines from stdin and search for the substring
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    for line in stdin.lock().lines() {
        let line = line.unwrap();
        if line.contains(substring) {
            println!("{}", line);
        }
    }
}
```

4. Save the file and compile it using the `rustc` compiler:

```sh
$ rustc substring_match.rs
```

This will create an executable called `substring_match` (or `substring_match.exe` on Windows).

5. Test your CLI app by running it with a substring argument and providing some input:

```sh
$ echo "Hello, World!\nRust is awesome!" | ./substring_match "Rust"
```

This should output:

```
Rust is awesome!
```

That's it! You've created a simple substring-match CLI app in Rust. You can now experiment with more advanced features and improve your Rust skills.

**Creating a Simple Substring-Match CLI App in Rust**

This guide will help you build a basic substring-match CLI app, similar to `grep`, but limited to string literals.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

- **Install Rust**: If you haven't already, install Rust using the official installer from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Choose an IDE or Text Editor**: Select a preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or text editor for coding.

### Step 2: Create a New Rust Project

- **Use Cargo**: Cargo is Rust's package manager. It will help you manage dependencies and build your project.

```bash
cargo new substring_match
cd substring_match
```

### Step 3: Write the Code

- **`src/main.rs`**: This is where your code will live.

```rust
// Import the necessary libraries
use std::env;
use std::fs;
use std::io;

// Define a function to perform the substring match
fn match_substring(file_path: &str, pattern: &str) -> Result<(), io::Error> {
    // Read the file
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(file_path)?;

    // Check if the pattern exists in the file
    if contents.contains(pattern) {
        println!("Pattern found in {}", file_path);
    } else {
        println!("Pattern not found in {}", file_path);
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    // Get the command-line arguments
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    // Check if the user provided the necessary arguments
    if args.len() != 3 {
        println!("Usage: {} <file_path> <pattern>", args[0]);
        return;
    }

    // Get the file path and pattern from the arguments
    let file_path = &args[1];
    let pattern = &args[2];

    // Perform the substring match
    match_substring(file_path, pattern).unwrap();
}
```

### Step 4: Run Your Code

- **Build and Run**: Use Cargo to build and run your code.

```bash
cargo run /path/to/your/file.txt "your search pattern"
```

### Example Use Case

- **Search for a Pattern**: Use the app to search for a specific pattern in a file.

```bash
cargo run /path/to/your/file.txt "your search pattern"
```

This will print whether the pattern exists in the file.

### Conclusion

This guide has walked you through creating a simple substring-match CLI app in Rust. You've learned how to:

- Set up your environment
- Create a new Rust project
- Write the code
- Run your code

This is a basic example to get you started. You can expand upon this by adding more features, such as handling multiple files or patterns.
