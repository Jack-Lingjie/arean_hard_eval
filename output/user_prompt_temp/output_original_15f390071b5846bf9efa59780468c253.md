Provide python code to calculate pie infinitely 

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Calculating pi infinitely is not possible, as it would require infinite time and resources. However, you can calculate pi to a high degree of precision using various algorithms. One such algorithm is the Chudnovsky algorithm, which converges to pi very quickly. Here's a Python implementation using the Chudnovsky algorithm:

```python
import decimal
import math

def chudnovsky_algorithm(precision):
    decimal.getcontext().prec = precision + 2
    C = 426880 * decimal.Decimal(10005).sqrt()
    M = 1
    L = 13591409
    X = 1
    K = 6
    S = L
    for i in range(1, precision):
        M = (K ** 3 - 16 * K) * M // i ** 3
        L += 545140134
        X *= -262537412640768000
        S += decimal.Decimal(M * L) / X
        K += 12
    pi = C / S
    decimal.getcontext().prec -= 2
    return +pi

precision = 100  # Number of decimal places
pi = chudnovsky_algorithm(precision)
print(pi)
```

This code calculates pi to the specified precision (100 decimal places in this example). You can increase the precision value to calculate pi to more decimal places, but keep in mind that it will require more time and resources.

**Calculating Pi Infinitely with Python**

Below is an example of how to calculate Pi infinitely using the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula (BBP formula). This formula allows for the calculation of any binary digit of Pi without having to calculate the preceding digits.

### Code

```python
def calculate_pi(n_terms):
    """
    Calculate Pi using the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula.

    Args:
    n_terms (int): The number of terms to use in the calculation.

    Returns:
    float: An approximation of Pi.
    """
    pi = 0.0
    for k in range(n_terms):
        pi += 1/(16**k) * (
            4/(8*k+1) -
            2/(8*k+4) -
            1/(8*k+5) -
            1/(8*k+6)
        )
    return pi

# Example usage:
n_terms = 1000000  # Increase this for a more accurate result
pi_approximation = calculate_pi(n_terms)
print(f"Approximation of Pi after {n_terms} terms: {pi_approximation}")
```

### Explanation

- **`calculate_pi` Function**: This function takes an integer `n_terms` as input, representing the number of terms to use in the BBP formula.
- **BBP Formula**: The formula is implemented within the loop. It calculates each term of the series and adds it to the running total of Pi.
- **Example Usage**: The code includes an example usage where `n_terms` is set to 1,000,000. You can adjust this value to calculate Pi to a higher degree of accuracy.

### Note

- **Accuracy**: Increasing `n_terms` improves the accuracy of the Pi approximation but also increases computation time.
- **Practical Limitations**: Due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic, there's a limit to how accurately you can represent Pi.
