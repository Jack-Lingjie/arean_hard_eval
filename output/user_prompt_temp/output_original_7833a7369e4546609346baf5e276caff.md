There is a game where a player is assigned a list of N unique numbers from 1 to T. Then, each round a number is drawn among the T numbers, excluding the ones that were drawn in the previous rounds. The game ends when all the numbers assigned to the player gets drawn. Write the recursive formula for the expected number of rounds to end the game (i.e. E(N,M))

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Let E(N, M) be the expected number of rounds to end the game, where N is the number of unique numbers assigned to the player and M is the total number of unique numbers from 1 to T.

We can derive the recursive formula for E(N, M) as follows:

1. If N = 0, then the game has already ended, so E(0, M) = 0.
2. If N > 0, then in the first round, there is a probability of N/M that one of the player's numbers is drawn, and a probability of (M-N)/M that none of the player's numbers are drawn.

In the case where one of the player's numbers is drawn, the player now has N-1 numbers left, and there are M-1 numbers remaining in total. So, the expected number of rounds to end the game in this case is E(N-1, M-1).

In the case where none of the player's numbers are drawn, the player still has N numbers left, and there are M-1 numbers remaining in total. So, the expected number of rounds to end the game in this case is 1 + E(N, M-1), as we add 1 round for the current round.

Therefore, the recursive formula for E(N, M) can be written as:

E(N, M) = (N/M) * E(N-1, M-1) + ((M-N)/M) * (1 + E(N, M-1))

with the base case E(0, M) = 0.

**Expected Number of Rounds to End the Game**

The problem describes a game where a player is assigned a list of unique numbers from 1 to T. Each round, a number is drawn among the T numbers, excluding the ones drawn in previous rounds. The game ends when all assigned numbers are drawn.

### Recursive Formula

Let's define the expected number of rounds to end the game as `E(N, T)`, where:

- `N` is the number of unique numbers assigned to the player.
- `T` is the total number of unique numbers.

The recursive formula for `E(N, T)` is:

```markdown
E(N, T) = 1 + 
          (1 / T) * 
          (sum from i=1 to N of 
           (i * E(N-i, T-1)))
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Base Case**: When `N = 0`, the game is already over, so `E(0, T) = 0`.

2. **Recursive Case**: For `N > 0`, consider the first number drawn. There are `T` possible numbers to draw.

3. **Probability**: The probability of drawing any specific number is `1/T`.

4. **Expected Value**: After drawing the first number, there are `N-1` numbers left to draw. The expected number of rounds to draw these remaining numbers is `E(N-1, T-1)`.

5. **Summation**: This process is repeated for each of the `N` numbers. The expected number of rounds to draw all `N` numbers is the sum of these expected values.

### Example Use Case

To calculate `E(3, 5)`, follow these steps:

1. **Base Case**: `E(0, 5) = 0`.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For `N = 1`, `E(1, 5) = 1 + (1/5) * E(0, 4) = 1 + (1/5) * 0 = 1`.
   - For `N = 2`, `E(2, 5) = 1 + (1/5) * (E(1, 4) + E(0, 4)) = 1 + (1/5) * (1 + 0) = 1.2`.
   - For `N = 3`, `E(3, 5) = 1 + (1/5) * (E(2, 4) + E(1, 4) + E(0, 4))`.

### Code Implementation

Here's a Python implementation of the recursive formula:

```python
def E(N, T):
    # Base case
    if N == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize sum
    total = 0
    
    # Recursive case
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        # Calculate E(N-i, T-1)
        remaining = E(N - i, T - 1)
        
        # Add i * E(N-i, T-1) to the total
        total += i * remaining
    
    # Return the expected value
    return 1 + (1 / T) * total

# Example usage
print(E(3, 5))
```

This code calculates the expected number of rounds to end the game for `N = 3` and `T = 5`.
