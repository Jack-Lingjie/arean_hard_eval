Suppose we have a job monitoring software and we want to implement a module that sends email alerts if a job takes too long to executie. The module should determine what is "too long" autonomously, based on the execution history.

We could calculate the arithmetic mean and standard deviation, and alert if the execution time is e.g. in the high 1%, but:
1) the execution time may depend on e.g. day of week (e.g. working day/weekend)
2) the execution time may have a global (upward) trend
3) the execution time may have sudden jumps due to underlying changes ("from Jan 1, we'll process both cash and card transactions, and the volume will suddenly jump 5x")

Can you outline some ideas on how to implement a system like this and address the bulleted points above?

To implement a system that sends email alerts if a job takes too long to execute, you can follow these steps:

1. Data collection and preprocessing:
   - Collect historical execution time data for each job, including timestamps and any relevant contextual information (e.g., day of the week, type of transaction, etc.).
   - Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and any necessary transformations.

2. Feature engineering:
   - Create features that capture the day of the week, time of day, and any other relevant contextual information.
   - Calculate rolling statistics (e.g., rolling mean, rolling standard deviation) to capture recent trends in execution time.

3. Model selection and training:
   - Choose a suitable model that can handle time series data and account for seasonality, trends, and sudden jumps. Some options include ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS), or even machine learning models like LSTM or Prophet.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets, and train the model on the training set.

4. Model evaluation and tuning:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, etc.).
   - Fine-tune the model's parameters to improve its performance, if necessary.

5. Anomaly detection and threshold setting:
   - Use the trained model to predict future execution times and calculate the residuals (i.e., the difference between actual and predicted execution times).
   - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the residuals, and set a threshold for alerting based on a chosen confidence level (e.g., 99% confidence interval).

6. Alerting system:
   - Monitor the execution times of jobs in real-time.
   - Compare the actual execution time with the predicted execution time from the model.
   - If the difference between the actual and predicted execution time exceeds the threshold, send an email alert.

7. Model updating and maintenance:
   - Periodically update the model with new data to ensure it stays up-to-date with the latest trends and patterns.
   - Monitor the model's performance and adjust the threshold or retrain the model as needed.

By following these steps, you can create a system that autonomously determines what is "too long" for a job's execution time and sends email alerts accordingly. This approach addresses the concerns of varying execution times based on the day of the week, global trends, and sudden jumps in execution time.

**Implementing a Job Monitoring System with Adaptive Email Alerts**

To create a robust job monitoring system, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Data Collection**

- **Store Execution History**: Record each job's execution time, including metadata like:
  - Date and time
  - Day of the week
  - Job type

### 2. **Data Analysis**

- **Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation**: Determine the average execution time and its standard deviation.
- **Identify Trends and Seasonality**: Use techniques like:
  - **Moving Averages**: Smooth out short-term fluctuations.
  - **Seasonal Decomposition**: Separate trends from seasonal patterns.

### 3. **Adaptive Thresholding**

- **High Percentile**: Alert if execution time exceeds a high percentile (e.g., 99th percentile).
- **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjust the threshold based on:
  - **Time of Day**: Different thresholds for working hours and weekends.
  - **Day of Week**: Different thresholds for weekdays and weekends.
  - **Global Trend**: Adjust the threshold to account for upward trends.

### 4. **Handling Sudden Jumps**

- **Anomaly Detection**: Use techniques like:
  - **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**: Monitor for deviations from expected behavior.
  - **Machine Learning**: Train models to detect unusual patterns.

### 5. **Email Alert System**

- **Configure Alert Triggers**: Set up alerts based on the adaptive threshold.
- **Customizable Alert Messages**: Include relevant details like job name, execution time, and threshold.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have a job that processes transactions. The execution time varies based on the day of the week and has an upward trend.

| Date       | Execution Time | Day of Week |
| :--------- | :------------- | :---------- |
| 2023-02-01 | 10 minutes      | Tuesday     |
| 2023-02-02 | 12 minutes      | Wednesday   |
| 2023-02-03 | 15 minutes      | Thursday    |

**Adaptive Thresholding**

- **High Percentile**: 99th percentile = 20 minutes
- **Dynamic Threshold**:
  - **Time of Day**: 15 minutes during working hours, 30 minutes during weekends
  - **Day of Week**: 18 minutes on weekdays, 25 minutes on weekends

**Handling Sudden Jumps**

- **Anomaly Detection**: Use SPC to monitor for deviations from expected behavior.

**Email Alert System**

- **Configure Alert Triggers**: Set up alerts for execution times exceeding the dynamic threshold.
- **Customizable Alert Messages**: Include relevant details like job name, execution time, and threshold.

By implementing these steps, you can create a robust job monitoring system that adapts to changing execution times and sends relevant email alerts.
