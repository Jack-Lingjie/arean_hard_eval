If a 7B parameter Transformer LLM at fp16 with batch size 1 and Sequence length is 500 tokens and bytes per token is 2 - needs 14GB VRAM, what would the VRAM requirement be if batch size is 50?

This is extremely important! Show your work. Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

Sure, let's work this out step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the memory requirement for a single token:
Memory per token = bytes per token * sequence length
Memory per token = 2 bytes * 500 tokens = 1000 bytes

2. Now, let's calculate the memory requirement for a single batch with batch size 1:
Memory per batch (batch size 1) = memory per token * batch size
Memory per batch (batch size 1) = 1000 bytes * 1 = 1000 bytes

3. We know that the 7B parameter Transformer LLM at fp16 with batch size 1 and sequence length 500 tokens requires 14GB VRAM. Let's convert this to bytes:
14 GB = 14 * 1024^3 bytes = 14 * 1,073,741,824 bytes = 15,032,084,992 bytes

4. Now, let's find out the memory requirement for the model itself (excluding the memory for the batch):
Memory for the model = Total memory - Memory per batch (batch size 1)
Memory for the model = 15,032,084,992 bytes - 1000 bytes = 15,032,083,992 bytes

5. Next, let's calculate the memory requirement for a single batch with batch size 50:
Memory per batch (batch size 50) = memory per token * batch size
Memory per batch (batch size 50) = 1000 bytes * 50 = 50,000 bytes

6. Finally, let's calculate the total memory requirement for the 7B parameter Transformer LLM at fp16 with batch size 50 and sequence length 500 tokens:
Total memory (batch size 50) = Memory for the model + Memory per batch (batch size 50)
Total memory (batch size 50) = 15,032,083,992 bytes + 50,000 bytes = 15,032,133,992 bytes

7. Convert the total memory requirement back to gigabytes:
Total memory (batch size 50) = 15,032,133,992 bytes / 1,073,741,824 bytes/GB â‰ˆ 14.00005 GB

So, the VRAM requirement for a 7B parameter Transformer LLM at fp16 with batch size 50 and sequence length 500 tokens would be approximately 14.00005 GB.

**Calculating VRAM Requirements**

To determine the VRAM requirement for a batch size of 50, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Bytes per Token

- **Bytes per Token**: 2 bytes
- **Sequence Length**: 500 tokens
- **Total Bytes**: 2 bytes/token \* 500 tokens = 1000 bytes

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Bytes per Batch

- **Batch Size**: 50
- **Total Bytes per Batch**: 1000 bytes/batch \* 50 batches = 50,000 bytes

### Step 3: Convert Total Bytes to Megabytes

- **Bytes to Megabytes**: 50,000 bytes / 1,048,576 bytes/MB = approximately 0.048 MB

### Step 4: Calculate VRAM Requirement

- **VRAM Requirement per Batch**: 0.048 MB
- **Total VRAM Requirement**: 0.048 MB/batch \* 50 batches = 2.4 MB

### Conclusion

The VRAM requirement for a batch size of 50 is approximately **2.4 MB**. 

This is a significant reduction from the original 14 GB requirement.
