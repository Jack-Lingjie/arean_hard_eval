1. Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Cells: Solar PV cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells are made of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, which absorb photons from sunlight and release electrons, creating a flow of electricity. This method does not involve any rotating generators or turbines.

2. Thermoelectric Generation: This method generates electricity by exploiting the Seebeck effect, where a voltage is created when there is a temperature difference between two dissimilar conductors. Thermoelectric generators can be used to convert waste heat from industrial processes or natural heat sources into electricity without any moving parts.

3. Piezoelectric Generation: Piezoelectric materials generate electricity when they are subjected to mechanical stress or strain. This property can be used to harvest energy from vibrations, pressure, or other mechanical forces. For example, piezoelectric materials can be embedded in roads or sidewalks to generate electricity from the pressure of passing vehicles or pedestrians.

4. Electrochemical Cells (Fuel Cells): Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction between a fuel (such as hydrogen) and an oxidant (such as oxygen). The reaction takes place at the electrodes, and the electrons flow through an external circuit, producing electricity. Fuel cells do not involve any rotating generators or turbines.

5. Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs): RTGs are a type of thermoelectric generator that uses the heat generated by the natural decay of radioactive isotopes to produce electricity. These generators are commonly used in space missions, where solar power is not feasible or reliable. The heat from the decaying isotopes is converted into electricity using thermoelectric materials, without any moving parts or turbines.
