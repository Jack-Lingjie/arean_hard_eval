write a program to play connect-4

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Here's a simple Python program to play Connect-4 in the terminal:

```python
import numpy as np

ROWS = 6
COLUMNS = 7
CONNECT = 4

def create_board():
    return np.zeros((ROWS, COLUMNS))

def is_valid_location(board, col):
    return board[ROWS-1][col] == 0

def get_next_open_row(board, col):
    for row in range(ROWS):
        if board[row][col] == 0:
            return row

def drop_piece(board, row, col, piece):
    board[row][col] = piece

def is_winning_move(board, piece):
    for c in range(COLUMNS - CONNECT + 1):
        for r in range(ROWS):
            if np.all(board[r, c:c+CONNECT] == piece):
                return True

    for c in range(COLUMNS):
        for r in range(ROWS - CONNECT + 1):
            if np.all(board[r:r+CONNECT, c] == piece):
                return True

    for c in range(COLUMNS - CONNECT + 1):
        for r in range(ROWS - CONNECT + 1):
            if np.all(np.diag(board[r:r+CONNECT, c:c+CONNECT]) == piece):
                return True

    for c in range(COLUMNS - CONNECT + 1):
        for r in range(CONNECT - 1, ROWS):
            if np.all(np.diag(np.fliplr(board[r-CONNECT+1:r+1, c:c+CONNECT])) == piece):
                return True

    return False

def print_board(board):
    print(np.flip(board, 0))

board = create_board()
game_over = False
turn = 0

print_board(board)

while not game_over:
    if turn == 0:
        col = int(input("Player 1, make your move (0-6): "))
        piece = 1
    else:
        col = int(input("Player 2, make your move (0-6): "))
        piece = 2

    if is_valid_location(board, col):
        row = get_next_open_row(board, col)
        drop_piece(board, row, col, piece)

        if is_winning_move(board, piece):
            print(f"Player {piece} wins!")
            game_over = True

        print_board(board)
        turn = (turn + 1) % 2
```

To play the game, copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., `connect4.py`) and run it using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python connect4.py`). The game will be played in the terminal, with players taking turns to input their moves.

**Connect-4 Game in Python**

### Game Overview

Connect-4 is a two-player board game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The first player to get four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

### Code

```python
# Connect-4 Game in Python

# Import the `random` module for player selection
import random

# Define the game board dimensions
BOARD_SIZE = 6
COLUMN_SIZE = 7

# Initialize the game board
def initialize_board():
    """Create an empty game board."""
    return [[" " for _ in range(COLUMN_SIZE)] for _ in range(BOARD_SIZE)]

# Print the game board
def print_board(board):
    """Display the current state of the game board."""
    print("\n".join([" ".join(row) for row in board]))

# Check for a win condition
def check_win(board, player):
    """Determine if the given player has won."""
    # Check horizontal locations for win
    for c in range(COLUMN_SIZE - 3):
        for r in range(BOARD_SIZE):
            if board[r][c] == board[r][c + 1] == board[r][c + 2] == board[r][c + 3] == player:
                return True

    # Check vertical locations for win
    for c in range(COLUMN_SIZE):
        for r in range(BOARD_SIZE - 3):
            if board[r][c] == board[r + 1][c] == board[r + 2][c] == board[r + 3][c] == player:
                return True

    # Check positively sloped diagonals
    for c in range(COLUMN_SIZE - 3):
        for r in range(BOARD_SIZE - 3):
            if board[r][c] == board[r + 1][c + 1] == board[r + 2][c + 2] == board[r + 3][c + 3] == player:
                return True

    # Check negatively sloped diagonals
    for c in range(COLUMN_SIZE - 3):
        for r in range(3, BOARD_SIZE):
            if board[r][c] == board[r - 1][c + 1] == board[r - 2][c + 2] == board[r - 3][c + 3] == player:
                return True

    # If no wins are found, return False
    return False

# Handle player moves
def make_move(board, column, player):
    """Update the game board with the given player's move."""
    for r in range(BOARD_SIZE - 1, -1, -1):
        if board[r][column] == " ":
            board[r][column] = player
            return

# Main game loop
def play_game():
    """Start a new game of Connect-4."""
    board = initialize_board()
    players = ["X", "O"]

    while True:
        # Select the current player
        current_player = players[(random.randint(0, 1))]

        # Print the current game board
        print_board(board)

        # Ask the current player for their move
        column = int(input(f"Player {current_player}, choose a column (1-7): ")) - 1

        # Validate the player's move
        if column < 0 or column >= COLUMN_SIZE:
            print("Invalid column. Please choose a column between 1 and 7.")
            continue

        # Make the player's move
        make_move(board, column, current_player)

        # Check for a win condition
        if check_win(board, current_player):
            print_board(board)
            print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
            break

# Start a new game
play_game()
```

### Example Use Cases

1. **Start a new game**: Run the `play_game()` function to begin a new game of Connect-4.
2. **Make a move**: When prompted, enter the number of the column where you'd like to drop your disc.
3. **Check the game board**: After each move, the current state of the game board will be displayed.

### Advice

*   To improve the game, consider adding features like:
    *   **Undo moves**: Allow players to undo their previous moves.
    *   **AI opponents**: Implement a simple AI opponent to play against.
    *   **Scorekeeping**: Keep track of the number of wins, losses, and draws for each player.
