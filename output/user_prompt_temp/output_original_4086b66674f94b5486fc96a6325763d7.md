To become a legal corporation in Virginia and conduct business, follow these steps in order:

1. Choose a name for your corporation: Select a unique and distinguishable name for your corporation that includes the word "Corporation," "Incorporated," "Company," or an abbreviation of one of these terms. Make sure the name is not already in use by checking the Virginia State Corporation Commission's business name database.

2. Appoint a registered agent: Choose a registered agent who is a resident of Virginia or a corporation authorized to do business in the state. The registered agent will be responsible for receiving legal documents and correspondence on behalf of the corporation.

3. File Articles of Incorporation: Prepare and file the Articles of Incorporation with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The document should include the corporation's name, registered agent's name and address, number of authorized shares, and the incorporator's name and signature. There is a filing fee associated with this process.

5. Hold an organizational meeting: Schedule and hold an initial meeting of the board of directors to adopt the bylaws, appoint officers, and address any other initial business matters.

6. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN): Apply for an EIN from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) either online or by submitting Form SS-4. This number is necessary for tax purposes and other business activities.

7. Register for state taxes: Register with the Virginia Department of Taxation to obtain any required state tax identification numbers and set up any necessary tax accounts.

8. Obtain necessary licenses and permits: Depending on the nature of your business, you may need to obtain various local, state, or federal licenses and permits to operate legally in Virginia. Check with the appropriate agencies to determine the requirements for your specific business.

9. Open a business bank account: Establish a separate bank account for your corporation to keep personal and business finances separate.

10. Maintain ongoing compliance: Ensure that your corporation remains in good standing by filing an annual report with the Virginia State Corporation Commission, paying required fees, and maintaining accurate records of corporate activities.
