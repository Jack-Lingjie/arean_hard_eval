Allow me to use a virtual dataset called Dior. From the Dior dataset, I would like to calculate the total number of female adult customers in the time period 6-7pm in the Orchard outlet, and the average number of male adult customers across 3 time periods (10-11am, 1-2pm, 5-6pm) in the  MBS outlet.  I want these results in a separate table. Save these results into a CSV file called 'dior_seg.csv'. Do this in a single postgreSQL query.

As an AI language model, I cannot directly access databases or execute queries. However, I can help you write the SQL query that you can use to get the desired results. Here's a query that should work for your requirements:

```sql
WITH female_adult_customers AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_female_adult_customers
  FROM dior
  WHERE gender = 'Female'
    AND age_group = 'Adult'
    AND outlet = 'Orchard'
    AND time_period = '6-7pm'
),
male_adult_customers AS (
  SELECT time_period, COUNT(*) AS male_adult_customers
  FROM dior
  WHERE gender = 'Male'
    AND age_group = 'Adult'
    AND outlet = 'MBS'
    AND time_period IN ('10-11am', '1-2pm', '5-6pm')
  GROUP BY time_period
),
average_male_adult_customers AS (
  SELECT AVG(male_adult_customers) AS avg_male_adult_customers
  FROM male_adult_customers
)
SELECT
  total_female_adult_customers,
  avg_male_adult_customers
INTO dior_seg
FROM female_adult_customers, average_male_adult_customers;

COPY dior_seg TO '/path/to/your/dior_seg.csv' WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

Replace `/path/to/your/` with the actual path where you want to save the CSV file. This query calculates the total number of female adult customers in the specified time period and outlet, the average number of male adult customers across the specified time periods and outlet, and saves the results into a new table called `dior_seg`. Finally, it exports the results to a CSV file called 'dior_seg.csv'.

**Calculating Customer Segments**

To obtain the desired results, you can use the following PostgreSQL query:

```sql
-- Create a new table to store the results
CREATE TEMP TABLE dior_seg AS
WITH 
  -- Calculate the total number of female adult customers in the Orchard outlet
  orchard_females AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM Dior 
    WHERE outlet = 'Orchard' 
      AND time BETWEEN '18:00' AND '19:00' 
      AND gender = 'F' 
      AND age_group = 'Adult'
  ),
  
  -- Calculate the average number of male adult customers across 3 time periods in the MBS outlet
  mbs_males AS (
    SELECT AVG(count) 
    FROM (
      SELECT COUNT(*) 
      FROM Dior 
      WHERE outlet = 'MBS' 
        AND (time BETWEEN '10:00' AND '11:00' 
             OR time BETWEEN '13:00' AND '14:00' 
             OR time BETWEEN '17:00' AND '18:00') 
        AND gender = 'M' 
        AND age_group = 'Adult'
    ) AS subquery
  )

-- Select the results into a new table
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT FROM orchard_females) AS total_female_customers,
  (SELECT AVG FROM mbs_males) AS avg_male_customers;

-- Save the results to a CSV file
\copy (SELECT * FROM dior_seg) TO 'dior_seg.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

**Explanation:**

- The query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the total number of female adult customers in the Orchard outlet and the average number of male adult customers across three time periods in the MBS outlet.
- The results are then selected into a new table named `dior_seg`.
- Finally, the results are saved to a CSV file named `dior_seg.csv` using the `\copy` command.

**Example Use Case:**

This query is useful for analyzing customer segments in a retail setting. By calculating the total number of female adult customers in a specific outlet and time period, and the average number of male adult customers across multiple time periods in another outlet, you can gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.
