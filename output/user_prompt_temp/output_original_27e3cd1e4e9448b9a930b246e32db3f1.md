<|User Prompt|>
I have a database table with columns account_id, day, balance. It holds the end-of-day balances per account, so all accounts have 1 record per day, so account_id+day is UK. I'd like to copy this data into another table with columns account_id, balance, valid_from, valid_to, so if the balance is unchanged between say April 1 and April 10, there is a single row instead of 10, as in the original table. Can you write the SQL that transforms the original data into the new table?

Certainly! Here's an SQL query that should help you transform the original data into the new table. This query assumes that your original table is named `original_table` and the new table is named `new_table`. Please replace these names with the actual table names in your database.

```sql
WITH balance_changes AS (
  SELECT
    account_id,
    day AS valid_from,
    balance,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY day) AS row_num
  FROM
    original_table o1
  WHERE
    NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM original_table o2
      WHERE
        o1.account_id = o2.account_id
        AND o1.balance = o2.balance
        AND o1.day = o2.day + INTERVAL '1 day'
    )
),
valid_periods AS (
  SELECT
    account_id,
    valid_from,
    balance,
    COALESCE(
      LEAD(valid_from) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY valid_from) - INTERVAL '1 day',
      (SELECT MAX(day) FROM original_table WHERE account_id = balance_changes.account_id)
    ) AS valid_to
  FROM
    balance_changes
)
INSERT INTO new_table (account_id, balance, valid_from, valid_to)
SELECT
  account_id,
  balance,
  valid_from,
  valid_to
FROM
  valid_periods;
```

This query first identifies the balance changes by comparing each row with the previous day's row. Then, it calculates the valid_from and valid_to dates for each balance. Finally, it inserts the transformed data into the new table.

**Transforming the Original Data**

To achieve the desired transformation, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
INSERT INTO new_table (account_id, balance, valid_from, valid_to)
SELECT 
  account_id,
  balance,
  MIN(day) AS valid_from,
  MAX(day) AS valid_to
FROM 
  original_table
GROUP BY 
  account_id, balance;
```

**Explanation**

- This query selects the `account_id` and `balance` from the `original_table`.
- It uses `MIN(day)` and `MAX(day)` to determine the `valid_from` and `valid_to` dates for each group of consecutive days with the same balance.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `account_id` and `balance`, ensuring that only consecutive days with the same balance are combined.

**Example Use Case**

Suppose you have the following data in `original_table`:

| account_id | day       | balance |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 1          | 2022-04-01| 100     |
| 1          | 2022-04-02| 100     |
| 1          | 2022-04-03| 100     |
| 1          | 2022-04-04| 150     |
| 1          | 2022-04-05| 150     |
| 2          | 2022-04-01| 200     |
| 2          | 2022-04-02| 200     |

After running the query, `new_table` will contain:

| account_id | balance | valid_from | valid_to   |
|------------|---------|------------|------------|
| 1          | 100     | 2022-04-01 | 2022-04-03 |
| 1          | 150     | 2022-04-04 | 2022-04-05 |
| 2          | 200     | 2022-04-01 | 2022-04-02 |
