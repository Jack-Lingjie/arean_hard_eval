How can I concatenate two gpx files on the Linux command line?

To concatenate two GPX files on the Linux command line, you can use the `xmlstarlet` tool. First, you need to install it if you haven't already:

```bash
sudo apt-get install xmlstarlet
```

Once you have `xmlstarlet` installed, you can use the following command to concatenate two GPX files, `file1.gpx` and `file2.gpx`, into a new file called `merged.gpx`:

```bash
xmlstarlet sel -t -c '/gpx' -o $'\n' -c '/gpx/metadata' -o $'\n' -c '/gpx/wpt' -o $'\n' -c '/gpx/rte' -o $'\n' -c '/gpx/trk' file1.gpx file2.gpx > merged.gpx
```

This command selects the `<gpx>`, `<metadata>`, `<wpt>`, `<rte>`, and `<trk>` elements from both files and writes them to the `merged.gpx` file.

To concatenate two GPX files on the Linux command line, you can use the `cat` command. Here's a simple way to do it:

1. **Open a Terminal**: First, open a terminal on your Linux system.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Navigate to the directory where your GPX files are located. You can do this by typing `cd /path/to/your/directory`.

3. **Concatenate the Files**: Use the `cat` command to concatenate the two GPX files. The basic syntax is:
   ```bash
   cat file1.gpx file2.gpx > combined_file.gpx
   ```
   - Replace `file1.gpx` and `file2.gpx` with the names of your GPX files.
   - `combined_file.gpx` is the name of the new file that will contain the concatenated data.

4. **Verify the Result**: After running the `cat` command, verify that the `combined_file.gpx` exists in the current directory. You can check this by listing the files in the directory with `ls`.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have two GPX files named `route1.gpx` and `route2.gpx` in your current directory. To concatenate them into a new file named `complete_route.gpx`, you would use the following command:

```bash
cat route1.gpx route2.gpx > complete_route.gpx
```

This command will create a new file named `complete_route.gpx` containing the data from both `route1.gpx` and `route2.gpx`.
