Given a binary array 'nums', you are required to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.

Explanation:

A binary array is an array that contains only 0s and 1s.
A subarray is any subset of the indices of the original array.
A contiguous subarray is a subarray in which all the elements are consecutive, i.e., any element between the first and last element of the subarray is also part of it.
Examples:
Input :nums = [0, 1]
Output : 2
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is [0, 1] with a length of 2.
Input : nums = [0, 1, 0]
Output : 2
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is either [0, 1] or [1, 0], both with a length of 2.
Input : nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
Output : 6
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] with a length of 6.
The problem requires finding the maximum length of a contiguous subarray in the binary array 'nums' that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.

To solve this problem, you can use a dictionary to store the difference between the number of 1s and 0s encountered so far while iterating through the array. The difference will be used as the key, and the index will be the value. If the same difference is encountered again, it means that there is a subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s between the two indices.

Here's a Python function to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s:

```python
def findMaxLength(nums):
    count = 0
    max_length = 0
    diff_dict = {0: -1}

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num == 0:
            count -= 1
        else:
            count += 1

        if count in diff_dict:
            max_length = max(max_length, i - diff_dict[count])
        else:
            diff_dict[count] = i

    return max_length
```

You can use this function with the given examples:

```python
nums1 = [0, 1]
print(findMaxLength(nums1))  # Output: 2

nums2 = [0, 1, 0]
print(findMaxLength(nums2))  # Output: 2

nums3 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
print(findMaxLength(nums3))  # Output: 6
```

This function will return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s for the given binary array 'nums'.

**Finding the Maximum Length of a Contiguous Subarray with Equal 0s and 1s**

Given a binary array `nums`, the goal is to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.

### Example Use Cases

- **Input**: `nums = [0, 1]`
- **Output**: `2`
  - The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is `[0, 1]` with a length of 2.

- **Input**: `nums = [0, 1, 0]`
- **Output**: `2`
  - The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is either `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, both with a length of 2.

- **Input**: `nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`
- **Output**: `6`
  - The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` with a length of 6.

### Solution

```python
def findMaxLength(nums):
    """
    Finds the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.

    Args:
    - nums (list): A binary array containing only 0s and 1s.

    Returns:
    - int: The maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
    """
    max_length = 0
    count = 0
    count_dict = {0: -1}  # Initialize dictionary with 0: -1

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Update count based on the current number
        if num == 0:
            count -= 1
        else:
            count += 1

        # If count is already in the dictionary, update max_length
        if count in count_dict:
            max_length = max(max_length, i - count_dict[count])
        else:
            # Otherwise, add count to the dictionary
            count_dict[count] = i

    return max_length

# Example usage:
print(findMaxLength([0, 1]))  # Output: 2
print(findMaxLength([0, 1, 0]))  # Output: 2
print(findMaxLength([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]))  # Output: 6
```

### Explanation

- The function `findMaxLength` takes a binary array `nums` as input.
- It initializes variables to keep track of the maximum length (`max_length`), the current count of 0s and 1s (`count`), and a dictionary (`count_dict`) to store the count and its index.
- The function iterates over the array, updating the `count` based on the current number.
- If the updated `count` is already in the `count_dict`, it updates `max_length` with the maximum length found so far.
- Otherwise, it adds the updated `count` to the `count_dict`.
- Finally, the function returns the maximum length found.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element in the array is processed once.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the `count_dict` dictionary.
