Joe the trainer has two solo workout plans that he offers his clients: Plan A and Plan B. Each client does either one or the other (not both). On Monday there were 9 clients who did Plan A and 7 who did Plan B. On Tuesday there were 3 clients who did Plan A and 5 who did Plan B. Joe trained his Monday clients for a total of 12 hours and his Tuesday clients for a total of 6 hours. How long does each of the workout plans last?     length of each plan A workout?                 length of each plan B workout

Let's use a system of linear equations to solve this problem. Let x be the length of each Plan A workout and y be the length of each Plan B workout.

On Monday, the total time spent on Plan A workouts is 9x, and the total time spent on Plan B workouts is 7y. The total time spent on Monday is 12 hours. So, the equation for Monday is:

9x + 7y = 12

On Tuesday, the total time spent on Plan A workouts is 3x, and the total time spent on Plan B workouts is 5y. The total time spent on Tuesday is 6 hours. So, the equation for Tuesday is:

3x + 5y = 6

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

9x + 7y = 12
3x + 5y = 6

To solve this system, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. First, we can multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:

9x + 7y = 12
9x + 15y = 18

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(9x + 15y) - (9x + 7y) = 18 - 12
8y = 6

Now, divide both sides by 8:

y = 6/8
y = 3/4

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation:

9x + 7(3/4) = 12

Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

36x + 21y = 48

Now, substitute the value of y:

36x + 21(3/4) = 48

Simplify:

36x + 15.75 = 48

Subtract 15.75 from both sides:

36x = 32.25

Now, divide both sides by 36:

x = 32.25/36
x = 0.895

So, the length of each Plan A workout is approximately 0.895 hours, and the length of each Plan B workout is 3/4 or 0.75 hours.

**Determining the Length of Each Workout Plan**

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \(A\) represent the length of each Plan A workout.
- Let \(B\) represent the length of each Plan B workout.

### Step 2: Formulate Equations Based on Client Numbers
- On Monday, 9 clients did Plan A and 7 did Plan B.
- On Tuesday, 3 clients did Plan A and 5 did Plan B.

### Step 3: Formulate Equations Based on Total Training Hours
- Joe trained his Monday clients for a total of 12 hours.
- Joe trained his Tuesday clients for a total of 6 hours.

### Step 4: Solve the System of Equations
- **Equation 1**: \(9A + 7B = 12\)
- **Equation 2**: \(3A + 5B = 6\)

### Step 5: Solve for \(A\) and \(B\)
- Multiply Equation 2 by 3 to align coefficients of \(A\): \(9A + 15B = 18\)
- Subtract Equation 1 from this new equation to solve for \(B\): \(8B = 6\)
- Solve for \(B\): \(B = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}\)

### Step 6: Solve for \(A\)
- Substitute \(B = \frac{3}{4}\) into Equation 1: \(9A + 7\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = 12\)
- Simplify: \(9A + \frac{21}{4} = 12\)
- Solve for \(A\): \(9A = 12 - \frac{21}{4}\)
- Convert 12 to a fraction with a denominator of 4: \(9A = \frac{48}{4} - \frac{21}{4}\)
- Simplify: \(9A = \frac{27}{4}\)
- Solve for \(A\): \(A = \frac{27}{4} \div 9\)
- Simplify: \(A = \frac{27}{4} \times \frac{1}{9}\)
- Simplify further: \(A = \frac{3}{4}\)

### Step 7: Interpret Results
- The length of each Plan A workout is \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour.
- The length of each Plan B workout is also \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour.

### Step 8: Provide Final Answer
- The length of each Plan A workout is \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour.
- The length of each Plan B workout is \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour.
