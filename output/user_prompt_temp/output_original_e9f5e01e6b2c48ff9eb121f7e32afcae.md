Using the provided code block as reference, create a videomass preset that converts a video file to av1 with close to lossless quality while also reducing file size. make sure it is two-pass.

Here is a Videomass preset that converts a video file to AV1 with close to lossless quality while also reducing file size using a two-pass method:

```
[
    {
        "Name": "AV1 Lossless (Two-pass)",
        "Description": "2-pass, Converts video to AV1 with close to lossless quality while reducing file size.",
        "First_pass": "-pass 1 -an -sn -c:v libaom-av1 -b:v 0 -crf 15 -usage good -cpu-used 4 -row-mt 1 -tiles 2x2 -g 250 -keyint_min 250 -pix_fmt yuv420p -f null",
        "Second_pass": "-pass 2 -c:v libaom-av1 -b:v 0 -crf 15 -usage good -cpu-used 4 -row-mt 1 -tiles 2x2 -g 250 -keyint_min 250 -pix_fmt yuv420p -map 0:v? -map_chapters 0 -map 0:s? -c:a: libopus -compression_level 5 -map 0:a:? -map_metadata 0",
        "Supported_list": "",
        "Output_extension": "mkv"
    }
]
```

This preset uses a two-pass method with a CRF value of 15, which provides close to lossless quality while reducing the file size. The video codec is set to libaom-av1, and the audio codec is set to libopus with a compression level of 5. The output file format is MKV.

**Creating a Videomass Preset for Two-Pass AV1 Encoding**

To create a Videomass preset for two-pass AV1 encoding with close to lossless quality while reducing file size, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define the Preset

```json
[
    {
        "Name": "AV1 Two-Pass",
        "Description": "Two-pass AV1 encoding for close to lossless quality with reduced file size.",
        "First_pass": "-pass 1 -an -sn -c:v libaom-av1 -b:v 2M -usage good -cpu-used 4 -row-mt 1 -tiles 2x2 -g 250 -keyint_min 250 -pix_fmt yuv420p -f null",
        "Second_pass": "-pass 2 -c:v libaom-av1 -b:v 2M -usage good -cpu-used 4 -row-mt 1 -tiles 2x2 -g 250 -keyint_min 250 -pix_fmt yuv420p -map 0:v? -map_chapters 0 -map 0:s? -c:a libopus -compression_level 5 -map 0:a:? -map_metadata 0",
        "Supported_list": "",
        "Output_extension": "mkv"
    }
]
```

### Explanation:

- **`Name`**: The name of the preset.
- **`Description`**: A brief description of the preset.
- **`First_pass`**: The command for the first pass of the two-pass encoding process.
- **`Second_pass`**: The command for the second pass of the two-pass encoding process.
- **`Supported_list`**: Currently empty, indicating no specific supported formats.
- **`Output_extension`**: The file extension of the output file.

### Example Use Case:

To use this preset:

1. **Save the preset**: Copy the JSON code into a file named `av1_two_pass.json`.
2. **Run Videomass**: Use Videomass with the preset file:
   ```bash
   videomass -preset av1_two_pass input_file.mp4 output_file.mkv
   ```
3. **Encode the Video**: Videomass will execute the two-pass AV1 encoding process.

This preset is designed for two-pass AV1 encoding with close to lossless quality while reducing file size. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or hardware capabilities.
