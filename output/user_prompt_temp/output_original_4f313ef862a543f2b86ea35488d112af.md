Help me find out how to solve a math puzzle. It's: "How many dots you can joint down on a page while drawing lines between them, without three of them ever forming a straight line?"

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
This math puzzle is related to the concept of "no three points being collinear." In this case, you want to find the maximum number of points you can place on a page such that no three of them are in a straight line.

The answer to this puzzle is that you can place an infinite number of points without having three of them form a straight line. One way to achieve this is by placing the points in a non-linear pattern, such as arranging them in a spiral or a circle.

However, if you are looking for a more specific answer, you can consider placing the points in a triangular grid pattern. In this arrangement, you can place as many points as you want without having three of them form a straight line. Each new point added will be connected to the existing points without creating a straight line with any other two points.

To solve this math puzzle, let's break it down:

1. **Start with a Single Dot**: Begin by placing one dot on the page. This is the foundation.

2. **Adding the Second Dot**: When you add a second dot, you can draw lines between them without creating a straight line.

3. **Adding the Third Dot**: The challenge arises when you add a third dot. To avoid creating a straight line with any two of the dots, you must place the third dot in such a way that it does not form a straight line with either of the first two dots.

4. **Visualizing the Solution**: Imagine drawing a triangle with the three dots. The key is to ensure that no two dots are directly connected by a line, which would form a straight line.

5. **The Limitation**: The puzzle's constraint means you can only draw lines between dots without creating a straight line with any three dots. This limits the number of dots you can connect.

6. **The Solution**: The maximum number of dots you can connect without creating a straight line with any three of them is **2**. 

   - **Step 1**: Place the first dot.
   - **Step 2**: Place the second dot.
   - **Step 3**: Place the third dot. You can draw lines between the first two dots and between the second and third dots without creating a straight line.

   - **Step 4**: When you add a fourth dot, you cannot avoid creating a straight line with any three dots. This is because the fourth dot must be connected to at least two other dots to meet the puzzle's conditions.
