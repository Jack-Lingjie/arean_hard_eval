How to write a program in the programming language Gambit Scheme (which is a specific scheme dialect) that reads lines from standard in, reverses the lines, and prints out the modified lines to standard out. Please only provide valid Gambit Scheme code. You can use the Gambit Scheme online manual as a reference.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Here's a Gambit Scheme program that reads lines from standard input, reverses the lines, and prints out the modified lines to standard output:

```scheme
;;; Load the required libraries
(include "~~lib/_io.scm")
(include "~~lib/_nonstd.scm")

;;; Define a function to reverse a string
(define (reverse-string str)
  (list->string (reverse (string->list str))))

;;; Define a function to read lines from standard input and reverse them
(define (read-reverse-lines)
  (let loop ((line (read-line)))
    (if (eof-object? line)
        (newline) ; End of input, print a newline and exit
        (begin
          (display (reverse-string line))
          (newline)
          (loop (read-line))))))

;;; Call the function to start the program
(read-reverse-lines)
```

To run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `reverse-lines.scm`) and execute it using the Gambit Scheme interpreter:

```
$ gsi reverse-lines.scm
```

Then, you can enter lines of text, and the program will output the reversed lines. To exit the program, press Ctrl+D (or the appropriate end-of-file key combination for your system).

**Reversing Lines in Gambit Scheme**

This program reads lines from standard input, reverses each line, and prints the modified lines to standard output.

### Code

```scheme
(define (reverse-lines)
  ; Read all lines from standard input
  (define lines (map (lambda (line) (string-trim line)) (port->lines (current-input-port))))

  ; Reverse each line
  (define reversed-lines (map reverse lines))

  ; Print the reversed lines to standard output
  (for-each (lambda (line) (display line) (newline)) reversed-lines))

(reverse-lines)
```

### Explanation

1. **Read Lines**: The `port->lines` function reads all lines from the current input port (standard input).
2. **Trim Lines**: `string-trim` removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line.
3. **Reverse Lines**: `reverse` reverses the order of characters in each line.
4. **Print Reversed Lines**: `for-each` applies the `display` and `newline` functions to each reversed line.

### Running the Program

To run this program:

1. Save the code in a file with a `.scm` extension.
2. Compile the file using `gambit` (e.g., `gambit myprogram.scm`).
3. Run the compiled program (e.g., `./myprogram`).

### Example Use Case

Input:
```text
Hello World
This is a test
```

Output:
```text
dlroW olleH
tset a si sihT
```
