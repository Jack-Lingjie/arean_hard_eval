Here's a Python program snippet that determines high sneezing and coughing etiquette to prevent the spread of germs for engineers and experts. The program uses if/else statements to handle various cases related to the bias. The control flow logic is clear and well-commented.

```python
# Function to determine high sneezing and coughing etiquette
def sneezing_coughing_etiquette(bias):
    # Check if the bias is related to engineers
    if bias.lower() == "engineer":
        print("For Engineers:")

        # High sneezing and coughing etiquette for engineers
        print("1. Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when you sneeze or cough.")
        print("2. Dispose of used tissues in a lined trash can.")
        print("3. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.")
        print("4. Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth.")
        print("5. Maintain a safe distance from others, especially in shared workspaces.")
    
    # Check if the bias is related to experts
    elif bias.lower() == "expert":
        print("For Experts:")

        # High sneezing and coughing etiquette for experts
        print("1. Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when you sneeze or cough.")
        print("2. Dispose of used tissues in a lined trash can.")
        print("3. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.")
        print("4. Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth.")
        print("5. Maintain a safe distance from others, especially in shared workspaces and during meetings.")
    
    # If the bias is not related to engineers or experts
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter either 'Engineer' or 'Expert'.")

# Test the function with different biases
sneezing_coughing_etiquette("Engineer")
sneezing_coughing_etiquette("Expert")
sneezing_coughing_etiquette("Other")
```

This program snippet defines a function called `sneezing_coughing_etiquette` that takes a bias as input. It checks if the bias is related to engineers or experts and prints the high sneezing and coughing etiquette accordingly. If the input is neither "Engineer" nor "Expert", it prints an error message.

**Preventing the Spread of Germs: High Sneezing and Coughing Etiquette**

### Program Overview

This Python program helps engineers and experts understand and follow high sneezing and coughing etiquette to prevent the spread of germs.

### Code

```python
def germ_prevention_etiquette(action):
    """
    Determine the appropriate action based on the situation.

    Args:
        action (str): The action taken by the individual.

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating the correct etiquette.
    """

    # Define a dictionary to map actions to their corresponding etiquette
    etiquette_guidelines = {
        "sneeze": "Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow.",
        "cough": "Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow.",
        "touch": "Wash your hands immediately.",
        "share": "Avoid sharing personal items.",
        "not_following": "Please follow the guidelines to prevent germ spread."
    }

    # Use a dictionary to handle various cases related to bias
    bias_cases = {
        "sneeze": "If you sneeze, cover your mouth and nose.",
        "cough": "If you cough, cover your mouth and nose.",
        "touch": "If you touch surfaces, wash your hands.",
        "share": "If you're asked to share, politely decline."
    }

    # Check if the action is in the etiquette guidelines
    if action in etiquette_guidelines:
        # Return the corresponding etiquette message
        return etiquette_guidelines[action]
    elif action in bias_cases:
        # Return the corresponding bias case message
        return bias_cases[action]
    else:
        # Return a default message if the action is not recognized
        return "Unknown action. Please try again."


# Example usage:
actions = ["sneeze", "cough", "touch", "share", "not_following"]

for action in actions:
    print(f"**{action.capitalize()}**: {germ_prevention_etiquette(action)}")
```

### Explanation

This program defines a function `germ_prevention_etiquette` that takes an `action` parameter. It uses a dictionary `etiquette_guidelines` to map actions to their corresponding etiquette messages.

The program also includes a dictionary `bias_cases` to handle various cases related to bias. This dictionary provides additional guidance for specific situations.

The function uses an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the correct etiquette message based on the input `action`. If the action is not recognized, it returns a default message.

### Example Use Cases

- **Sneezing**: If you sneeze, cover your mouth and nose.
- **Coughing**: If you cough, cover your mouth and nose.
- **Touching Surfaces**: If you touch surfaces, wash your hands.
- **Sharing Personal Items**: If you're asked to share, politely decline.
- **Not Following Guidelines**: Please follow the guidelines to prevent germ spread.

### Control Flow Logic

The program's control flow logic is clear and well-commented:

- It uses dictionaries to map actions to their corresponding etiquette messages.
- It includes a dictionary to handle various cases related to bias.
- It uses an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the correct etiquette message based on the input `action`.
- It returns a default message if the action is not recognized.

This program provides a clear and concise guide to high sneezing and coughing etiquette, helping engineers and experts prevent the spread of germs.
