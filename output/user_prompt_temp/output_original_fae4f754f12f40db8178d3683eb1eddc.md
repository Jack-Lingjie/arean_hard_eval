write pcre regex for not containing  C:\

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To write a PCRE regex that does not contain "C:\", you can use a negative lookahead assertion. Here's the regex pattern:

```
^(?!.*C:\\).+$
```

Explanation:

- `^` : Start of the line
- `(?!` : Start of the negative lookahead assertion
- `.*` : Any character (except a newline) 0 or more times
- `C:\\` : The string "C:\" (the double backslash is used to escape the backslash character)
- `)` : End of the negative lookahead assertion
- `.+` : Any character (except a newline) 1 or more times
- `$` : End of the line

To match a string that does not contain "C:\", you can use a negative lookahead assertion in PCRE (Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions). 

Here's how you can do it:

- **Negative Lookahead**: `(?!...)` is used to check if there is no match for the pattern inside the parentheses.

- **Escape Backslash**: Since backslash (`\`) is a special character in regex, you need to escape it with another backslash (`\\`) to match a literal backslash.

- **Pattern**: `C:` is matched directly.

- **Combining It All**: The pattern to match a string that does not contain "C:\" is `(?!C:\\).*`.

Here's a breakdown:

- `(?!C:\\)`: This is a negative lookahead assertion. It checks if the string does not match "C:\".

- `.*`: This matches any character (.) any number of times (*). The `.*` ensures that the string can be of any length.

### Example Use Case

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $string = "This string does not contain C:\\";
if ($string =~ /^(?!C:\\).*$/) {
    print "The string does not contain 'C:\\'.\n";
} else {
    print "The string contains 'C:\\'.\n";
}
```

This script checks if the string `$string` does not contain "C:\". If it doesn't, it prints a corresponding message.
