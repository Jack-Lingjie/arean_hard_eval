<|User Prompt|>
Hello. I have the next python class for playable and npc characters:
class Character:

    def __init__(self, char_data):
        self.name = char_data["name"]
        self.hp = char_data["hp"]
        self.damage = char_data["damage"]  

I want you to implement Action class which will take response for different interactions between characters (like heal, dealing damage and etc.). We are using data-drive approach, so class should be very general and powered by some config files.
Example of actions we may like to implement:
1. Deal damage to target.
2. Heal actor.
3. Heal target.
4. Deal damage to target based on portion of target's health.
5. Deal damage to target based on portion of actor's health. Actor should take some damage too.
6. Deal damage to target and heal actor for portion of that damage (life leech)
Theese are not all actions we are going to implement, just an example of how general should be action class and how powerful should be our configuration system.
Feel free to implement simple DSL if needed to solve this task

To implement the Action class and make it general and configurable, we can use a dictionary to store the action functions and their corresponding configurations. Here's an example implementation:

```python
class Action:
    def __init__(self, action_data):
        self.action_type = action_data["action_type"]
        self.config = action_data["config"]

    def execute(self, actor, target):
        action_functions = {
            "deal_damage": self.deal_damage,
            "heal_actor": self.heal_actor,
            "heal_target": self.heal_target,
            "deal_damage_based_on_target_health": self.deal_damage_based_on_target_health,
            "deal_damage_based_on_actor_health": self.deal_damage_based_on_actor_health,
            "life_leech": self.life_leech,
        }

        action_function = action_functions.get(self.action_type)
        if action_function:
            action_function(actor, target, self.config)
        else:
            print(f"Invalid action type: {self.action_type}")

    def deal_damage(self, actor, target, config):
        target.hp -= actor.damage * config["multiplier"]

    def heal_actor(self, actor, target, config):
        actor.hp += config["heal_amount"]

    def heal_target(self, actor, target, config):
        target.hp += config["heal_amount"]

    def deal_damage_based_on_target_health(self, actor, target, config):
        damage = target.hp * config["health_percentage"]
        target.hp -= damage

    def deal_damage_based_on_actor_health(self, actor, target, config):
        damage = actor.hp * config["health_percentage"]
        target.hp -= damage
        actor.hp -= config["actor_damage"]

    def life_leech(self, actor, target, config):
        damage = actor.damage * config["multiplier"]
        target.hp -= damage
        actor.hp += damage * config["leech_percentage"]
```

Here's an example of how to use the Action class with the Character class:

```python
# Example character data
char_data1 = {"name": "Player1", "hp": 100, "damage": 10}
char_data2 = {"name": "Player2", "hp": 100, "damage": 10}

player1 = Character(char_data1)
player2 = Character(char_data2)

# Example action data
action_data = {
    "action_type": "deal_damage",
    "config": {
        "multiplier": 1.5
    }
}

action = Action(action_data)
action.execute(player1, player2)
```

You can easily add more actions by defining new functions in the Action class and adding them to the `action_functions` dictionary. The configuration for each action can be customized by modifying the `config` dictionary in the action_data.

**Action Class Implementation**

To create a general and powerful `Action` class, we'll use a data-driven approach with configuration files. This will allow for easy extension and modification of actions.

### Action Class

```python
class Action:
    def __init__(self, config):
        """
        Initialize the Action class.

        :param config: Action configuration dictionary.
        """
        self.config = config
        self.name = config["name"]
        self.description = config["description"]

    def execute(self, actor, target):
        """
        Execute the action.

        :param actor: The character performing the action.
        :param target: The character affected by the action.
        """
        # Perform the action based on the configuration
        action_type = self.config["type"]
        if action_type == "damage":
            self._deal_damage(actor, target)
        elif action_type == "heal":
            self._heal(actor, target)
        elif action_type == "life_leech":
            self._life_leech(actor, target)
        # Add more action types as needed

    def _deal_damage(self, actor, target):
        """
        Deal damage to the target.

        :param actor: The character performing the action.
        :param target: The character affected by the action.
        """
        damage = self.config["damage"]
        target.hp -= damage
        print(f"{target.name} took {damage} damage.")

    def _heal(self, actor, target):
        """
        Heal the target.

        :param actor: The character performing the action.
        :param target: The character affected by the action.
        """
        heal_amount = self.config["heal"]
        target.hp += heal_amount
        print(f"{target.name} was healed for {heal_amount}.")

    def _life_leech(self, actor, target):
        """
        Deal damage to the target and heal the actor.

        :param actor: The character performing the action.
        :param target: The character affected by the action.
        """
        damage = self.config["damage"]
        actor.hp += damage // 2  # Heal the actor for half of the damage
        target.hp -= damage
        print(f"{target.name} took {damage} damage. {actor.name} gained {damage // 2} health.")
```

### Configuration File

Create a configuration file (e.g., `actions.json`) with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Deal Damage",
    "description": "Deal damage to the target.",
    "type": "damage",
    "damage": 10
  },
  {
    "name": "Heal Target",
    "description": "Heal the target.",
    "type": "heal",
    "heal": 5
  },
  {
    "name": "Life Leech",
    "description": "Deal damage to the target and heal the actor.",
    "type": "life_leech",
    "damage": 15
  },
  {
    "name": "Deal Damage Based on Target's Health",
    "description": "Deal damage to the target based on its current health.",
    "type": "damage",
    "damage": "target_hp * 0.1"
  },
  {
    "name": "Deal Damage Based on Actor's Health",
    "description": "Deal damage to the target and take damage based on the actor's current health.",
    "type": "damage",
    "damage": "actor_hp * 0.2"
  }
]
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Load the configuration file
import json
with open("actions.json") as f:
    actions_config = json.load(f)

# Create a character
character = Character({"name": "Player", "hp": 100, "damage": 10})

# Create an action
action = Action(actions_config[0])  # Deal Damage

# Execute the action
action.execute(character, character)  # Deal damage to the player
```

This implementation provides a general `Action` class that can be extended with various action types. The configuration file allows for easy modification and addition of new actions.
