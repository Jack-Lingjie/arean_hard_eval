When I buy groceries, I like to get an odd number of coins for change. For example, when  I get 20 cents, I like 2 coins of 5 cents, and 1 coin of 10 cents. If I buy 3 pears at 25 cents each, and 1 lemon for 10 cents, and I pay with a 1 dollar bill, which coins will I get?

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items you are buying:

3 pears at 25 cents each = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 dollars
1 lemon at 10 cents = 0.10 dollars

Total cost = 0.75 + 0.10 = 0.85 dollars

Now, let's calculate the change you will receive:

Change = 1 dollar - 0.85 dollars = 0.15 dollars or 15 cents

To get an odd number of coins for 15 cents, you can receive 1 coin of 10 cents and 2 coins of 5 cents. This will give you a total of 3 coins, which is an odd number.

**Calculating the Total Cost**

- The cost of 3 pears at 25 cents each is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) cents.
- The cost of 1 lemon is 10 cents.

**Total Cost**

The total cost is \(75 + 10 = 85\) cents.

**Change Calculation**

Given a payment of $1 (100 cents), the change due is \(100 - 85 = 15\) cents.

**Coin Combinations**

To get an odd number of coins, consider the following combinations:
- 1 coin of 10 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents.
- 3 coins of 5 cents.

Both combinations result in an odd number of coins.
