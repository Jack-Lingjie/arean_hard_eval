I've trained a predictor using GluonTS on multiple related datasets. I've got a list of forecasts and timeseries that i created like this:
    forecast_it, ts_it = make_evaluation_predictions(
        dataset=test_ds,  # test dataset
        predictor=predictor,  # predictor
        num_samples=100,  # number of sample paths we want for evaluation
    )

    forecasts = list(forecast_it)
    timeseries = list(ts_it)

How do i calculate the mean squared error and standard deviation and potential other usefull metrics for evaluation.

You can use the Evaluator class from GluonTS to compute various evaluation metrics, including mean squared error (MSE) and standard deviation. Here's how you can do it:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from gluonts.evaluation import Evaluator
from gluonts.evaluation.backtest import make_evaluation_predictions
```

2. Create an Evaluator instance:

```python
evaluator = Evaluator(quantiles=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9])
```

3. Use the `evaluator` to compute the evaluation metrics:

```python
agg_metrics, item_metrics = evaluator(iter(timeseries), iter(forecasts), num_series=len(test_ds))
```

4. Access the mean squared error (MSE), standard deviation, and other metrics:

```python
mse = agg_metrics["MSE"]
std_dev = agg_metrics["wQuantileLoss[0.5]"]
```

You can print the `agg_metrics` dictionary to see all the available metrics:

```python
print(agg_metrics)
```

This will give you an output similar to the following:

```
{
 'MSE': 12345.678,
 'abs_error': 98765.432,
 'abs_target_sum': 56789.012,
 'abs_target_mean': 3456.789,
 'seasonal_error': 2345.678,
 'MASE': 1.234,
 'sMAPE': 0.123,
 'MSIS': 12.345,
 'QuantileLoss[0.1]': 6789.012,
 'Coverage[0.1]': 0.123,
 'QuantileLoss[0.5]': 5678.901,
 'Coverage[0.5]': 0.234,
 'QuantileLoss[0.9]': 4567.890,
 'Coverage[0.9]': 0.345,
 'RMSE': 111.213,
 'NRMSE': 0.321,
 'ND': 1.732,
 'wQuantileLoss[0.1]': 0.123,
 'wQuantileLoss[0.5]': 0.234,
 'wQuantileLoss[0.9]': 0.345,
 'mean_wQuantileLoss': 0.234,
 'MAE_Coverage': 0.123
}
```

You can also print the `item_metrics` DataFrame to see the metrics for each individual time series:

```python
print(item_metrics.head())
```

This will give you an output similar to the following:

```
   item_id       MSE  ...  wQuantileLoss[0.9]  mean_wQuantileLoss
0        0  12345.678  ...            0.345            0.234
1        1  23456.789  ...            0.456            0.345
2        2  34567.890  ...            0.567            0.456
3        3  45678.901  ...            0.678            0.567
4        4  56789.012  ...            0.789            0.678

```

Now you have the mean squared error, standard deviation, and other useful evaluation metrics for your GluonTS model.

**Evaluating Time Series Forecasts with GluonTS**

To calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Standard Deviation (SD), and other useful metrics for evaluating time series forecasts, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
from gluonts.evaluation import Evaluator
from gluonts.evaluation.backtest import make_evaluation_predictions
```

### Step 2: Calculate Metrics

```python
# Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
mse = np.mean([(f - t) ** 2 for f, t in zip(forecasts, timeseries)])

# Calculate Standard Deviation (SD)
sd = np.std([(f - t) ** 2 for f, t in zip(forecasts, timeseries)])

# Use GluonTS's built-in Evaluator for more metrics
evaluator = Evaluator(forecast_length=forecast_it.forecast_length)
forecast_items, ts_items = make_evaluation_predictions(
    dataset=test_ds, predictor=predictor, num_samples=100
)

eval_results, _ = evaluator(ts_items, forecast_items)

# Print the evaluation results
print("MSE:", mse)
print("SD:", sd)
print("MAE:", eval_results.mean_absolute_error)
print("RMSE:", np.sqrt(eval_results.mean_squared_error))
print("MAPE:", eval_results.mean_absolute_percentage_error)
```

### Explanation

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average squared difference between forecast and actual values.
- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: The square root of the variance of the squared differences.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average absolute difference between forecast and actual values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the average squared difference between forecast and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: The average absolute percentage difference between forecast and actual values.

### Example Use Case

This code snippet is useful for evaluating the performance of a time series forecasting model. By calculating these metrics, you can assess the accuracy and reliability of your model's predictions.
