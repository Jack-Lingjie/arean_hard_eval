<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
1. Title: Display Brightness Compliance with Dimming Specification

2. Description: The display system shall ensure that the base values of the brightness for the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) never cause a display brightness that is specified as dangerous by the dimming specification.

3. Rationale: This requirement is necessary to ensure the safety of the vehicle occupants and to comply with the ISO 26262 standard.

4. Acceptance Criteria:

4.1. The display system shall have a brightness control mechanism that adheres to the dimming specification.

4.2. The display system shall have a predefined set of base brightness values that are within the safe limits defined by the dimming specification.

4.3. The display system shall not allow the user to set the brightness value beyond the safe limits defined by the dimming specification.

4.4. The display system shall automatically adjust the brightness based on the ambient light conditions to maintain a safe level of brightness as per the dimming specification.

4.5. The display system shall provide visual and/or audible warnings to the user if the brightness level approaches the dangerous limits specified in the dimming specification.

5. Verification Methods:

5.1. Inspection: Review the display system design documentation to ensure that the brightness control mechanism and base brightness values are in compliance with the dimming specification.

5.2. Test: Perform tests on the display system to verify that the brightness control mechanism functions as intended and does not allow the brightness to exceed the dangerous limits specified in the dimming specification.

5.3. Analysis: Analyze the test results to confirm that the display system meets the acceptance criteria and adheres to the ISO 26262 standard.

6. Dependencies:

6.1. The dimming specification document shall be available and up-to-date.

6.2. The display system design documentation shall be complete and accurate.

7. Safety Criticality: This requirement is safety-critical, as non-compliance with the dimming specification may result in dangerous brightness levels that could distract the driver and increase the risk of accidents.

8. Traceability:

8.1. This requirement is derived from the ISO 26262 standard and the dimming specification.

8.2. This requirement is related to other requirements concerning the display system, such as display readability, user interface design, and ambient light sensing.
