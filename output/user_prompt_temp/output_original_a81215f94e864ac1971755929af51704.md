Take on the rol eof an Gherkin expert. Can you improve this Gherkin (Cuucmber tests) and move the following text in separate scenarios? 

Scenario: Confirm Contour
  Given the user confirms the contours
  Then the Confirm Contour button becomes invisible
  And the following markers are visible in the navigation control:
    | Marker 			   | View    |
    | ES     			   | Current |
    | OAC    			   | Current |
    | OAC    			   | Both    |
	| LA Major Axis Length | Both 	 | cm  |
  And the following Global LAS values are shown for both views:
    | LAS Type | View    |
    | LAS-R    | Current |
    | LAS-R    | Both    |
    | LAS-CD   | Current |
    | LAS-CD   | Both    |
    | LAS-CT   | Current |
    | LAS-CT   | Both    |
  And the following information is shown in the current view:
    | Frame Number | Marker | Indication |
    | Auto         | ES     |            |
    | Auto         | OAC    |            |
    | Heartrate    |        |            |
  And the following overall statistics are shown:
    | Statistic       	| Value  |
    | Average HR      	| bpm    |
    | Delta HR        	| bpm    |
    | Minimum Framerate | fps  	 |
