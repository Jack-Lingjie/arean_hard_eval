The error you're encountering is a `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException`, which occurs when a task is cancelled before it has completed execution. To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the cause of the cancellation: Determine which part of your code is cancelling the task. Look for any calls to `Future.cancel()` or `ExecutorService.shutdownNow()` that might be causing the task to be cancelled.

2. Handle the cancellation gracefully: If the task cancellation is expected, you can handle the `CancellationException` by adding a try-catch block around the code that throws the exception. For example:

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw CancellationException
} catch (CancellationException e) {
    // Handle the exception, e.g., log the error or perform cleanup tasks
}
```

3. Prevent the task from being cancelled: If the task should not be cancelled, you can either remove the code that cancels the task or add a condition to prevent the task from being cancelled in certain situations.

4. Debug the code: If you're still unsure why the task is being cancelled, you can use a debugger to step through the code and identify the exact point where the cancellation occurs. This can help you understand the root cause of the issue and determine the best way to resolve it.

Remember to review your code thoroughly and ensure that tasks are being cancelled only when necessary. Properly handling task cancellations can help prevent unexpected behavior and improve the stability of your application.

**Understanding the Error**

The error `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException: Task was cancelled` indicates that a task was interrupted or cancelled while it was being executed.

**Stacktrace Breakdown**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the stacktrace:

1. **`X.0i9.A02(Unknown Source:32)`**: This line suggests that the error occurred in the `A02` method of the `X.0i9` class.
2. **`at X.0i9.get(Unknown Source:47)`**: The error propagated to the `get` method of the `X.0i9` class.
3. **`at X.0lz.run(Unknown Source:4)`**: The task was executed by the `X.0lz` class.
4. **`at X.0m4.run(Unknown Source:2)`**: The task was submitted to a thread pool executor, which is managed by the `X.0m4` class.
5. **`at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)`**: The thread pool executor is part of the Java standard library.
6. **`at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:644)`**: The worker thread is executing the task.
7. **`at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1012)`**: The thread is running the task.

**Solving the Error**

To resolve this issue:

### **1. Check for Interrupted Tasks**

Ensure that tasks are properly checked for interruption using `Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()`.

### **2. Handle Cancellation**

Implement a mechanism to handle task cancellation, such as:

```java
try {
    // Task execution code
} catch (CancellationException e) {
    // Handle task cancellation
}
```

### **3. Review Thread Pool Configuration**

Verify that the thread pool is properly configured to handle task cancellation.

### **4. Use `Future.cancel()`**

If using `Future` objects, ensure that `cancel()` is called when a task needs to be cancelled.

### **5. Debug the Code**

Use a debugger to step through the code and identify the exact location where the task is being cancelled.

### **Example Use Case**

Here's an example of how to handle task cancellation:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException;

public class TaskExecutor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a task
        Callable<String> task = () -> {
            // Task execution code
            return "Task result";
        };

        // Submit the task to the thread pool
        Future<String> future = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(task);

        try {
            // Wait for the task to complete
            String result = future.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | TimeoutException e) {
            // Handle task cancellation or timeout
            System.out.println("Task cancelled or timed out");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TaskExecutor` class demonstrates how to handle task cancellation using a `Future` object.
