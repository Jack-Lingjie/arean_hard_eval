**Disrupt Pattern**
At 1st level, you can use your action to disrupt the patterns of a creature within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check. The damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

At 3rd level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell.
