<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Question: A small object of mass 0.5 kg is attached to a string of length 1.5 m and is being swung in a horizontal circle at a constant speed. The tension in the string is 15 N. Calculate the angular velocity of the object and the time it takes to complete one full revolution.

Mark Scheme:

1. Calculate the centripetal force acting on the object (1 mark)
2. Calculate the linear velocity of the object (1 mark)
3. Calculate the angular velocity of the object (1 mark)
4. Calculate the time period for one full revolution (1 mark)

Answer:

1. The centripetal force acting on the object is equal to the tension in the string, which is 15 N.

2. To calculate the linear velocity (v) of the object, we can use the formula for centripetal force: F_c = (mv^2) / r
   Rearranging the formula to solve for v: v = sqrt(F_c * r / m)
   Substituting the values: v = sqrt(15 N * 1.5 m / 0.5 kg) = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.71 m/s

3. To calculate the angular velocity (ω), we can use the formula: v = ω * r
   Rearranging the formula to solve for ω: ω = v / r
   Substituting the values: ω = 6.71 m/s / 1.5 m ≈ 4.47 rad/s

4. To calculate the time period (T) for one full revolution, we can use the formula: T = 2π / ω
   Substituting the values: T = 2π / 4.47 rad/s ≈ 1.41 s

So, the angular velocity of the object is approximately 4.47 rad/s, and it takes about 1.41 seconds to complete one full revolution.

**A-Level Exam Question: Circular Motion**

**Question**

A particle of mass 2 kg is moving in a horizontal circle with a radius of 4 m. The particle completes one full revolution in 10 s.

**Part 1**

1. **Calculate** the **angular velocity** (ω) of the particle.

**Part 2**

2. **Determine** the **centripetal force** (F) acting on the particle.

**Part 3**

3. **Explain** why the centripetal force is necessary for the particle to move in a circular path.

**Mark Scheme**

### Part 1

- **Angular Velocity (ω)**: 
  - **Formula**: ω = 2π / T  
  - **Given**: T = 10 s  
  - **Calculation**: ω = 2π / 10 = π / 5 rad/s  
  - **Answer**: π / 5 rad/s

### Part 2

- **Centripetal Force (F)**: 
  - **Formula**: F = (m * v^2) / r  
  - **Given**: m = 2 kg, r = 4 m  
  - **First, find the velocity (v)**: v = ω * r  
  - **Substitute ω = π / 5 rad/s and r = 4 m**: v = (π / 5) * 4  
  - **Calculate v**: v = 4π / 5 m/s  
  - **Now, calculate F**: F = (2 * (4π / 5)^2) / 4  
  - **Simplify**: F = (2 * 16π^2 / 25) / 4  
  - **Further simplify**: F = 4π^2 / 25 N

### Part 3

- **Explanation**: The centripetal force is necessary for the particle to move in a circular path because it acts towards the center of the circle, providing the necessary acceleration to keep the particle moving in a curved path.

**Answer**

- **Part 1**: The angular velocity (ω) of the particle is π / 5 rad/s.
- **Part 2**: The centripetal force (F) acting on the particle is 4π^2 / 25 N.
- **Part 3**: The centripetal force is necessary for the particle to move in a circular path because it acts towards the center of the circle, providing the necessary acceleration to keep the particle moving in a curved path.
