I have an interesting problem: I have someone who implements a cryptographic function for me as follows:

- There is a HSM that contains a secret k that I know
- The HSM creates a derived key using a HKDF
- The derived key is then usable for communication

Above operations are deterministic. However, I want that some randomness is being incorporated in order to have perfect forward security. The current idea is to take the deterministic derived key of the HKDF and hash it together with some random number to get a session key as follows: session_key = sha(derived key, random)

But now I have different problem: On the running system I cannot verify whether the session key is really the product of randomness or whether a backdoor has been implemented. Is there mechanism that allows me to make the procedure verifiable?

Yes, you can make the procedure verifiable by using a commitment scheme. A commitment scheme allows one party to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden, and later reveal the chosen value. This can be used to ensure that the random number used in the session key generation is indeed random and not manipulated.

Here's a simple way to implement a verifiable procedure using a commitment scheme:

1. Generate a random number `r` and compute its hash `H(r)`. This hash will serve as the commitment to the random number.
2. Share the hash `H(r)` with the other party.
3. Perform the session key generation: `session_key = sha(derived_key, r)`.
4. When needed, reveal the random number `r` to the other party.
5. The other party can now verify that the random number `r` was used in the session key generation by computing the hash `H(r)` and comparing it to the previously shared commitment.

This way, you can ensure that the random number used in the session key generation is indeed random and not manipulated, as the other party can verify the commitment. Note that this method assumes that the hash function used (e.g., SHA-256) is secure and collision-resistant.

You want to ensure perfect forward security by incorporating randomness into the cryptographic process. However, you're concerned about verifying that the session key is indeed generated from the random number and not compromised by a backdoor.

To address this, consider the following mechanisms:

1. **Use a **Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)**:**
   - Compute `hmac(derived_key, random)` instead of `sha(derived_key, random)`.
   - This ensures that any modification to the input will result in a different output, making it detectable.

2. **Employ a **Deterministic Randomness Beacon** (DRB):**
   - Use a DRB to generate the random number. This ensures the randomness is verifiable and comes from a trusted source.

3. **Implement **Provable Secure Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)**:**
   - Use a PRNG that is designed to be secure and verifiable. This can provide a high level of assurance.

4. **Add **Digital Signatures**:**
   - Have the HSM sign the session key with its private key. This allows verification of the session key's origin.

5. **Use **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (ZKP):**
   - Implement a ZKP protocol to prove possession of the derived key without revealing it.

6. **Consider **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)**:**
   - Use SMPC to securely combine the derived key and random number without revealing either.

7. **Regularly **Audit and Test** the System:**
   - Periodically test the system for vulnerabilities and backdoors.

By incorporating one or more of these mechanisms, you can ensure the session key is generated securely and verifiably.
