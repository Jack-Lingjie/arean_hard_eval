Quartz is a static site generator designed specifically for Obsidian, allowing you to publish your notes as a website. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up and using Quartz:

1. Install Node.js and npm:
   Quartz requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to run. If you don't have them installed, visit the Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest LTS version. The installation process will also install npm.

2. Install Quartz:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Quartz globally:
   
   ```
   npm install -g quartz-obsidian
   ```

3. Create a new folder for your website:
   Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store the generated website files. This folder will be separate from your Obsidian vault.

4. Initialize Quartz:
   In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the newly created folder using the `cd` command. For example:

   ```
   cd /path/to/your/website/folder
   ```

   Then, run the following command to initialize Quartz in the folder:

   ```
   quartz init
   ```

   This will create a `quartz.json` configuration file in the folder.

5. Configure Quartz:
   Open the `quartz.json` file in a text editor and update the configuration to point to your Obsidian vault. Set the `vault` property to the path of your Obsidian vault folder. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "vault": "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault",
     "exclude": ["_layouts", "_assets", "quartz.json"]
   }
   ```

   You can also customize other settings, such as excluding specific files or folders from being published.

6. Create a layout:
   In your Obsidian vault, create a new folder called `_layouts`. Inside this folder, create a new file called `default.html`. This file will serve as the default layout for your generated website.

   Edit `default.html` and add the following basic HTML structure:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8">
     <title>{{ title }}</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     {{ content }}
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   The `{{ title }}` and `{{ content }}` placeholders will be replaced with the note title and content, respectively, when the site is generated.

7. Generate the website:
   In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your website folder (if you're not already there) and run the following command:

   ```
   quartz build
   ```

   This will generate the static website files in a new `public` folder inside your website folder.

8. Preview the website:
   To preview your website locally, you can use a simple HTTP server. One option is to use the `http-server` package from npm. Install it globally with the following command:

   ```
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

   Then, navigate to the `public` folder in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```
   http-server
   ```

   This will start a local server, and you can view your website by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

9. Publish the website:
   To publish your website, you can use any web hosting service that supports static websites, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Upload the contents of the `public` folder to your chosen hosting service, following their specific instructions.

10. Update the website:
    Whenever you make changes to your Obsidian notes and want to update the published website, simply run the `quartz build` command again in your website folder. This will regenerate the website files in the `public` folder. Then, upload the updated files to your hosting service.

That's it! You've successfully set up and used Quartz to publish your Obsidian notes as a static website.
