Write a python class "Circle" that inherits from class "Shape"

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To create a Circle class that inherits from a Shape class, you can follow the example below:

```python
class Shape:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def area(self):
        pass

    def perimeter(self):
        pass

    def __str__(self):
        return f"This is a {self.name}."


class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        super().__init__("Circle")
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius ** 2

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius

    def __str__(self):
        return f"This is a {self.name} with radius {self.radius}."


# Example usage:
circle = Circle(5)
print(circle)  # This is a Circle with radius 5.
print("Area:", circle.area())  # Area: 78.53975
print("Perimeter:", circle.perimeter())  # Perimeter: 31.4159
```

In this example, the Circle class inherits from the Shape class. The Circle class has its own `__init__`, `area`, `perimeter`, and `__str__` methods, which override the corresponding methods in the Shape class.

**Circle Class Inheritance**
================================

Below is an example of a Python class `Circle` that inherits from the `Shape` class.

### Code

```python
# Define the Shape class
class Shape:
    """Base class for shapes."""
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def area(self):
        """Method to calculate the area of the shape."""
        pass

    def perimeter(self):
        """Method to calculate the perimeter of the shape."""
        pass


# Define the Circle class
class Circle(Shape):
    """
    A class used to represent a Circle.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    radius : float
        The radius of the circle.

    Methods:
    -------
    area()
        Calculates the area of the circle.
    perimeter()
        Calculates the perimeter of the circle.
    """

    def __init__(self, radius):
        """
        Initializes a Circle object.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        radius : float
            The radius of the circle.
        """
        super().__init__()
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        """
        Calculates the area of the circle.

        Returns:
        -------
        float
            The area of the circle.
        """
        return 3.14159 * (self.radius ** 2)

    def perimeter(self):
        """
        Calculates the perimeter of the circle.

        Returns:
        -------
        float
            The perimeter of the circle.
        """
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius
```

### Explanation

- **Shape Class**: This is the base class for all shapes. It includes methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a shape.
- **Circle Class**: This class inherits from the `Shape` class. It has an `__init__` method to initialize a circle with a given radius. The `area` and `perimeter` methods are overridden to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle.

### Example Use Case

```python
# Create a Circle object
circle = Circle(5)

# Calculate the area and perimeter of the circle
area = circle.area()
perimeter = circle.perimeter()

# Print the results
print(f"Area: {area}")
print(f"Perimeter: {perimeter}")
```

This example demonstrates how to create a `Circle` object and use its methods to calculate its area and perimeter.
