As a manager, it is important to balance the needs of the project, the team dynamics, and the well-being of the individual team member. In this situation, I would take the following steps to ensure a fair and constructive resolution:

1. Assess the situation: Before taking any action, I would gather information about the team member's performance, the impact on the project, and the personal challenges they are facing. This would involve reviewing their work, discussing the issue with other team members, and understanding the nature of their personal challenges.

2. Private conversation: I would schedule a private meeting with the team member to discuss their performance and the impact it is having on the project. During this conversation, I would express empathy and understanding for their personal challenges, while also emphasizing the importance of meeting the project's deadlines and quality standards.

3. Offer support: I would explore ways to support the team member in addressing their personal challenges, such as providing access to counseling services, adjusting their workload, or offering flexible work hours. This would demonstrate my commitment to their well-being and help them feel valued as a member of the team.

4. Set clear expectations: I would work with the team member to establish clear performance expectations and a plan for improvement. This might involve setting specific goals, providing additional training or resources, or assigning a mentor to help guide their work.

5. Monitor progress: I would regularly check in with the team member to discuss their progress and provide feedback on their work. This would help ensure that they are making improvements and staying on track with the project's deadlines and quality standards.

6. Communicate with the team: I would keep the rest of the team informed about the situation, without disclosing personal details about the team member's challenges. This would help maintain trust and transparency within the team, while also reinforcing the importance of meeting the project's goals.

7. Evaluate and adjust: If the team member's performance does not improve despite the support and resources provided, I would consider additional steps, such as reassigning tasks or adjusting the project timeline. This would help ensure the project's success while also taking into account the well-being of the individual team member.

By taking these steps, I would aim to create a supportive and inclusive work environment that values the contributions of each team member, while also ensuring the success of the project and the overall performance of the team.
