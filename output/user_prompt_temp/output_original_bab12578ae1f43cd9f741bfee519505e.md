To run a cron job on weekdays at 19:00 (7 PM) in the New York time zone, you can use the following cron syntax:

```
0 19 * * 1-5
```

Here's the explanation of each field in the cron syntax:

1. `0`: This field represents the minute when the job will run. In this case, it's set to 0, which means the job will run at the beginning of the hour.

2. `19`: This field represents the hour when the job will run. In this case, it's set to 19, which means the job will run at 7 PM.

3. `*`: This field represents the day of the month. The asterisk (*) means the job will run every day of the month.

4. `*`: This field represents the month. The asterisk (*) means the job will run every month.

5. `1-5`: This field represents the day of the week. In this case, it's set to 1-5, which means the job will run from Monday (1) to Friday (5).

To account for the New York time zone, you'll need to set the time zone in your cron job configuration. The time zone for New York is "America/New_York". The method to set the time zone depends on the cron job service or system you are using. For example, in a Unix-based system, you can set the time zone by adding the following line to your crontab file:

```
TZ=America/New_York
```

So, your final crontab file would look like this:

```
TZ=America/New_York
0 19 * * 1-5 /path/to/your/script.sh
```

This configuration will run the script.sh file at 7 PM on weekdays in the New York time zone.

**Cron Syntax for Running a Job on Weekdays at 19:00 (New York Time Zone)**

To run a job on weekdays at 19:00 in the New York time zone, use the following cron syntax:

```bash
0 19 * * 1-5 /path/to/your/script.sh
```

**Explanation:**

- **`0 19`**: This specifies the minute and hour of the day. The `0` represents the minute (at the top of the hour), and `19` represents the hour (7 PM).

- **`*`**: This is a wildcard that matches any value. It's used for the day of the month (`* *`) and the month (`*`).

- **`1-5`**: This specifies the days of the week. The numbers represent Monday (1) through Friday (5).

- **`/path/to/your/script.sh`**: Replace this with the actual path to your script.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose you have a script named `daily_report.sh` located in the `/home/user/scripts` directory. To run this script daily at 19:00, you would use:

```bash
0 19 * * 1-5 /home/user/scripts/daily_report.sh
```

This ensures that the script runs every weekday at 7 PM New York time.
