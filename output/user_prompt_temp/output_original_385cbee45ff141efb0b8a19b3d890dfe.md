Act as a professional expert and engineer in troubleshooting industrial machines, more specifically Injection Molding Machines. I have an issue with my machine, I noticed that The oil pump motor and oil pump start, but no pressure.

I understand that you're experiencing an issue with your injection molding machine where the oil pump motor and oil pump start, but there is no pressure. As a professional expert and engineer, I would recommend you to follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the oil level: Ensure that the oil level in the tank is sufficient. If the oil level is too low, it may cause the pump to not generate enough pressure. Refill the oil tank if necessary.

2. Inspect the oil filter: A clogged oil filter can restrict the flow of oil and cause a drop in pressure. Check the filter for any signs of blockage or contamination and replace it if necessary.

3. Examine the oil pump: Inspect the oil pump for any signs of wear or damage. If the pump is damaged, it may not be able to generate enough pressure. In this case, you may need to replace the oil pump.

4. Check the pressure relief valve: The pressure relief valve is designed to release excess pressure in the system. If it is stuck open or not functioning properly, it can cause a loss of pressure. Inspect the valve for any signs of wear or damage and replace it if necessary.

5. Inspect the hydraulic hoses and connections: Check all hydraulic hoses and connections for any signs of leaks or damage. If any leaks are found, repair or replace the damaged components.

6. Examine the hydraulic pump drive coupling: The coupling between the motor and the pump can wear out or become damaged, causing a loss of pressure. Inspect the coupling for any signs of wear or damage and replace it if necessary.

7. Check the pressure gauge: It's possible that the pressure gauge itself is faulty and not accurately displaying the pressure. Verify the gauge's accuracy by comparing it to another known good gauge or by using a pressure transducer.

8. Inspect the hydraulic system: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, there may be a problem with the hydraulic system itself. In this case, you may need to consult with a hydraulic specialist or the machine manufacturer for further assistance.

Remember to always follow safety procedures and guidelines when working on industrial machines. If you are unsure about any of the steps or require further assistance, please consult with a qualified technician or the machine manufacturer.

**Troubleshooting Injection Molding Machine Issue**

The oil pump motor and oil pump starting but not generating pressure indicates a potential problem with the system. Here are some steps to help identify the issue:

### **1. Check the Oil Pump**

- **Motor Operation**: Ensure the motor is functioning correctly. If it's not turning on, check the power supply and electrical connections.
- **Pump Operation**: Verify the pump is working. If it's not, inspect the pump for blockages or damage.

### **2. Pressure Gauge**

- **Check the Pressure Gauge**: Ensure the pressure gauge is functioning correctly. If it's not showing any pressure, check the gauge for blockages or damage.

### **3. Oil Flow**

- **Check Oil Flow**: Verify oil is flowing from the pump to the system. If not, inspect the oil lines for blockages or damage.

### **4. System Leaks**

- **Check for Leaks**: Inspect the system for any signs of leaks. Leaks can prevent pressure from building up.

### **5. Oil Level**

- **Check Oil Level**: Ensure the oil level is at the recommended level. Low oil levels can prevent the pump from generating pressure.

### **6. Pump Settings**

- **Check Pump Settings**: Verify the pump settings are correct. Incorrect settings can prevent the pump from generating pressure.

### **7. System Blockages**

- **Check for Blockages**: Inspect the system for any blockages. Blockages can prevent pressure from building up.

### **8. Consult the Manual**

- **Consult the Manual**: Refer to the machine's manual for troubleshooting guides specific to the oil pump system.

### **9. Contact the Manufacturer**

- **Contact the Manufacturer**: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact the machine's manufacturer for further assistance.

### **10. Professional Assistance**

- **Seek Professional Help**: If the issue persists, consider seeking the help of a professional engineer or the machine's manufacturer for further assistance.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and potentially resolve the issue with your injection molding machine's oil pump system.
