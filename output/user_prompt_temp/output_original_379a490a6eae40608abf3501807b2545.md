 Consider the state:
$$\ket{\psi} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10}}{\sqrt{3}}$$

(a). Calculate the reduced density matrix of the second qubit of $\ket{\psi}$.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To calculate the reduced density matrix of the second qubit, we first need to find the density matrix of the entire state, and then trace out the first qubit. 

The density matrix of the entire state is given by:
$$\rho = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$$

Substituting the given state, we get:
$$\rho = \frac{1}{3}(\ket{00}\bra{00} + \ket{00}\bra{01} + \ket{00}\bra{10} + \ket{01}\bra{00} + \ket{01}\bra{01} + \ket{01}\bra{10} + \ket{10}\bra{00} + \ket{10}\bra{01} + \ket{10}\bra{10})$$

Now, we need to find the reduced density matrix of the second qubit by tracing out the first qubit. The reduced density matrix is given by:
$$\rho_2 = \mathrm{Tr}_1(\rho)$$

Tracing out the first qubit, we get:
$$\rho_2 = \frac{1}{3}(\bra{0}\ket{0}\bra{0}\ket{0} + \bra{0}\ket{0}\bra{0}\ket{1} + \bra{1}\ket{1}\bra{0}\ket{0} + \bra{0}\ket{0}\bra{1}\ket{1} + \bra{0}\ket{0}\bra{1}\ket{0} + \bra{1}\ket{1}\bra{1}\ket{1})$$

Simplifying the terms, we get:
$$\rho_2 = \frac{1}{3}\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

So, the reduced density matrix of the second qubit is:
$$\rho_2 = \frac{1}{3}\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

## Step 1: Identify the state $\ket{\psi}$ and its components.
The given state is $\ket{\psi} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10}}{\sqrt{3}}$. This state is a superposition of three basis states.

## Step 2: Express the state $\ket{\psi}$ in a more detailed form to facilitate calculations.
To calculate the reduced density matrix of the second qubit, we first need to express $\ket{\psi}$ in a more detailed form. This involves expanding the given superposition.

## Step 3: Calculate the density matrix of the state $\ket{\psi}$.
To find the reduced density matrix of the second qubit, we first need to calculate the full density matrix of $\ket{\psi}$. The density matrix $\rho$ of a state $\ket{\psi}$ is given by $\rho = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$.

## Step 4: Calculate $\bra{\psi}$.
To find $\bra{\psi}$, we take the complex conjugate of each term in $\ket{\psi}$.

## Step 5: Compute $\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$.
We multiply $\ket{\psi}$ by $\bra{\psi}$ to obtain the density matrix $\rho$.

## Step 6: Identify the reduced density matrix of the second qubit.
The reduced density matrix of the second qubit is obtained by tracing out the first qubit from the full density matrix.

## Step 7: Perform the calculation for the reduced density matrix.
Given $\ket{\psi} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10}}{\sqrt{3}}$, we can calculate the reduced density matrix by first finding the density matrix $\rho$ of $\ket{\psi}$ and then tracing out the first qubit.

## Step 8: Calculate the density matrix $\rho$.
The density matrix $\rho$ of $\ket{\psi}$ is given by:
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{3}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

## Step 9: Trace out the first qubit to obtain the reduced density matrix.
To trace out the first qubit, we sum over the first qubit's indices.

## Step 10: Perform the trace operation.
The reduced density matrix $\rho_2$ of the second qubit is obtained by tracing out the first qubit from $\rho$.

## Step 11: Calculate the reduced density matrix $\rho_2$.
After tracing out the first qubit, we obtain the reduced density matrix $\rho_2$.

## Step 12: Simplify the reduced density matrix $\rho_2$.
The reduced density matrix $\rho_2$ simplifies to:
\[
\rho_2 = \frac{1}{3}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

## Step 13: Finalize the reduced density matrix $\rho_2$.
The reduced density matrix $\rho_2$ is:
\[
\rho_2 = \frac{1}{3}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

## Step 14: Write the final answer.
The final answer is: $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 & 1/3 \\ 1/3 & 1/3 \\ \end{pmatrix}}$
