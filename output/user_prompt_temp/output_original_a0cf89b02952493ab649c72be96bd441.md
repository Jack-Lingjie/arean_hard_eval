<|User Prompt|>
I would like my MATLAB script to wait until the user closes all open figures, in any order, before continuing.  Can you write lines of MATLAB code that will do this?

Certainly! You can use the following lines of MATLAB code to make your script wait until the user closes all open figures:

```MATLAB
while ~isempty(findall(0, 'Type', 'figure'))
    pause(1);
end
```

This code uses a while loop to check if there are any open figures. The `findall` function searches for all objects of type 'figure', and the loop continues until there are no open figures left. The `pause(1)` command inside the loop ensures that the script waits for 1 second before checking again, preventing excessive CPU usage.

You can use the following MATLAB code to pause the script until all figures are closed:

```matlab
% Pause the script until all figures are closed
while get(0, 'Visible') 
    % Do nothing, wait for user to close all figures
end
```

Here's how it works:

- `get(0, 'Visible')` checks if any figures are still visible.
- The `while` loop continues to execute as long as there are visible figures.
- Once all figures are closed, the loop exits, and the script continues.

This approach allows the user to close figures in any order before the script proceeds. 

**Example Use Case:**

```matlab
% Create some figures
figure;
figure;
figure;

% Pause the script until all figures are closed
while get(0, 'Visible') 
    % Do nothing, wait for user to close all figures
end

% Script continues here
disp("All figures closed. Continuing...");
```
