Make code in a synapse notebook that deletes a folder from a connected filesystem

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To delete a folder from a connected filesystem in a Synapse notebook, you can use the Python `shutil` library. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to delete a folder:

```python
import shutil
import os

# Replace 'your_folder_path' with the path to the folder you want to delete
folder_path = 'your_folder_path'

# Check if the folder exists
if os.path.exists(folder_path):
    # Delete the folder and its contents
    shutil.rmtree(folder_path)
    print(f"Folder '{folder_path}' has been deleted.")
else:
    print(f"Folder '{folder_path}' does not exist.")
```

Replace `'your_folder_path'` with the path to the folder you want to delete. This code will check if the folder exists and then delete it along with its contents. If the folder does not exist, it will print a message indicating that the folder was not found.

**Deleting a Folder from a Connected Filesystem in Synapse Notebook**

To delete a folder from a connected filesystem in a Synapse Notebook, you can use the following Python code:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete the folder.
- The folder path should be correctly specified.

### Code

```python
# Import the necessary library
import os

# Specify the path to the folder you want to delete
folder_path = "/your/file/system/path/folder_to_delete"

# Check if the folder exists
if os.path.exists(folder_path):
    # Attempt to delete the folder
    try:
        # Use os.rmdir() for empty directories or shutil.rmtree() for directories with contents
        import shutil
        shutil.rmtree(folder_path)
        print(f"Folder '{folder_path}' deleted successfully.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Permission denied to delete folder '{folder_path}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Folder '{folder_path}' does not exist.")
```

### Explanation

- **Importing Libraries**: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries. `os` is used for interacting with the operating system, and `shutil` is used for high-level file operations.
- **Specifying the Folder Path**: Replace `"/your/file/system/path/folder_to_delete"` with the actual path to the folder you want to delete.
- **Checking Folder Existence**: The code checks if the specified folder exists.
- **Deleting the Folder**: If the folder exists, it attempts to delete it. For empty directories, `os.rmdir()` is used. For directories with contents, `shutil.rmtree()` is used.
- **Handling Exceptions**: The code catches `PermissionError` and any other exceptions that might occur during the deletion process.

### Example Use Case

- **Scenario**: You need to delete a folder named `temp_data` located at `/data/temp_data`.
- **Code Modification**: Replace `folder_path` with `"/data/temp_data"`.
- **Execution**: Run the modified code in your Synapse Notebook.

This code provides a basic approach to deleting a folder from a connected filesystem in Synapse. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and handle exceptions appropriately based on your specific use case.
