2. Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and bell pepper, and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened.

3. Add the chopped spinach to the skillet and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted.

6. Serve immediately with whole-grain toast or a side of fresh fruit for a complete and balanced breakfast.

This recipe serves 2 and provides approximately 30 grams of protein per serving, depending on the specific ingredients used. Feel free to customize the recipe with your favorite vegetables or protein sources, such as cooked chicken or turkey sausage.
