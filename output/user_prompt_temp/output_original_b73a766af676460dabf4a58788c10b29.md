**Calculating the Time After a Wait**

To find the time after waiting for 1.65 hours, start with the current time, which is 1:00 AM.

- **Step 1**: Convert 1.65 hours into hours and minutes.  
  - Hours: 1.65 hours  
  - Minutes: 1.65 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 99 minutes

- **Step 2**: Add the converted hours and minutes to the current time.
  - Current time: 1:00 AM  
  - Wait time: 1 hour 59 minutes (since 99 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour and 59 minutes)

- **Step 3**: Calculate the final time.
  - Final time: 2:59 AM

Therefore, after waiting for 1.65 hours, it will be **2:59 AM**.
