Can you come up with a 12 bar chord progression in C that works in the lydian mode?


<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Sure! In the Lydian mode, the chords are built on the scale degrees of the Lydian scale. Here's a 12-bar chord progression in C Lydian:

| Cmaj7  | Dmaj7  | Em7    | F#m7b5 |

| Cmaj7  | Dmaj7  | Em7    | F#m7b5 |

| Cmaj7  | Dmaj7  | Em7    | Cmaj7  |

This progression uses the I, II, iii, and ivÂ° chords of the C Lydian mode.

To create a 12-bar chord progression in the key of C that incorporates the Lydian mode, we can use the following chords:

- Bars 1-4: C Major (I)  
- Bars 5-6: E Major (V)  
- Bars 7-8: A Major (bVII)  
- Bars 9-12: G Major (bIII)  

This progression maintains a sense of resolution while incorporating the Lydian mode's distinctive sound. The use of the bVII (A Major) and bIII (G Major) chords adds tension and release, which is characteristic of the Lydian mode.
