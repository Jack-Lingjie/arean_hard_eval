How to create media entity in Drupal?

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Creating a media entity in Drupal involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a media entity in Drupal 8 and 9:

1. Install and enable required modules:
To work with media entities, you need to have the following modules installed and enabled:
   - Media
   - Media Library

These modules are included in Drupal core for versions 8.4 and later. If you're using an earlier version, you'll need to install the contributed Media Entity module.

2. Create a media type:
A media type is a bundle that defines the fields and settings for a specific type of media entity. To create a media type:

   a. Go to the Drupal admin area, and navigate to Structure > Media types > Add media type.
   b. Enter a name and description for the media type.
   c. Choose a media source plugin that determines how the media item will be stored and displayed. For example, you can choose 'Image' for image files, 'Video' for video files, or 'Remote video' for videos hosted on external platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.
   d. Configure the media source plugin settings, if necessary.
   e. Save the media type.

3. Add fields to the media type:
You can add additional fields to the media type to store metadata or other information related to the media entity.

   a. Go to Structure > Media types, and click 'Manage fields' next to the media type you created.
   b. Click 'Add field' and choose the field type you want to add.
   c. Configure the field settings and save the field.

4. Configure the media type form display:
You can customize the form used to create and edit media entities of this type.

   a. Go to Structure > Media types, and click 'Manage form display' next to the media type you created.
   b. Arrange the fields and configure their widgets as needed.
   c. Save the form display configuration.

5. Configure the media type display:
You can customize how media entities of this type will be displayed when embedded in content or viewed directly.

   a. Go to Structure > Media types, and click 'Manage display' next to the media type you created.
   b. Arrange the fields and configure their formatters as needed.
   c. Save the display configuration.

6. Create a media entity:
Now that you have a media type, you can create media entities of that type.

   a. Go to Content > Media > Add media, and choose the media type you created.
   b. Fill in the fields, including uploading or selecting the media item.
   c. Save the media entity.

7. Embed the media entity in content:
To use the media entity in your content, you can either add a media reference field to a content type or use the media library in a text editor.

   a. For a media reference field, go to Structure > Content types > [Your content type] > Manage fields, and add a new field of type 'Reference > Media'.
   b. Configure the field settings, including selecting the media type you created.
   c. Save the field, and update the form and display configurations as needed.
   d. When creating or editing content of this type, you can now select and embed media entities using the media reference field.

   e. For the media library in a text editor, make sure the 'Media Library' module is enabled, and configure the text format to include the 'Embed media' button. Then, when editing content with that text format, you can use the button to browse and embed media entities.

That's it! You've successfully created a media entity in Drupal. You can now use and manage media entities in your Drupal site.

### Code Example

**Creating a Media Entity Programmatically**

```php
use Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityManagerInterface;
use Drupal\media\Entity\Media;

// Get the entity manager.
$entityManager = \Drupal::service('entity.manager');

// Create a new media entity.
$media = Media::create([
  'bundle' => 'image',
  'name' => 'Company Logo',
]);

// Set the file.
$media->setFile('path/to/company-logo.png');
