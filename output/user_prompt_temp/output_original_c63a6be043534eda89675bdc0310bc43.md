Find a fix for this bug : 
```This model maximum context length is 2048 tokens. However, your messages resulted in over 2364 tokens.```

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To fix this bug, you need to reduce the number of tokens in your input text to be within the model's maximum context length, which is 2048 tokens in this case. Here's a possible solution:

1. First, identify the parts of your input text that can be shortened or removed without losing important information.
2. If possible, split the input text into smaller chunks and process them separately. Then, combine the results afterward.
3. If the text still exceeds the token limit after shortening, consider truncating the text to fit within the limit. Keep in mind that this may result in loss of information.

Here's a Python example to truncate the input text to fit within the token limit:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your_pretrained_model_name")
max_tokens = 2048

input_text = "your_long_input_text_here"
encoded_input = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=max_tokens)
```

In this example, the `truncation=True` and `max_length=max_tokens` arguments ensure that the input text is truncated to fit within the model's maximum context length.

**Resolving the Model Context Length Exceedance Bug**

The error message indicates that the model's maximum context length is **2048 tokens**, but the input messages exceed this limit by **2364 tokens**.

### **Solution**

To resolve this issue, you can:

#### **Option 1: Reduce the Input Message Length**

- **Step 1**: **Split the input message** into smaller chunks, each within the 2048 token limit.
- **Step 2**: **Process each chunk** separately.

#### **Option 2: Increase the Model's Context Length**

- **Step 1**: **Check if the model supports** increasing its context length.
- **Step 2**: **Adjust the model settings** to accommodate longer input messages.

### **Example Code**

**Option 1: Splitting Input Messages**

```python
def process_message(message):
    # Define the maximum allowed tokens
    max_tokens = 2048
    
    # Split the message into chunks
    chunks = [message[i:i+max_tokens] for i in range(0, len(message), max_tokens)]
    
    # Process each chunk
    for chunk in chunks:
        # Perform your model operations here
        print(f"Processing chunk: {chunk}")
```

**Option 2: Increasing Model Context Length**

```python
def adjust_model_settings(model):
    # Check if the model supports increasing context length
    if model.supports_context_length_increase:
        # Adjust the model settings
        model.context_length = 4096  # Example increase to 4096 tokens
        print("Model context length increased.")
    else:
        print("Model does not support increasing context length.")
```

### **Best Practices**

- Always check the model's documentation for supported features and limitations.
- Consider the trade-off between increasing context length and model performance.
- Implement robust error handling to handle cases where input messages exceed the limit.
