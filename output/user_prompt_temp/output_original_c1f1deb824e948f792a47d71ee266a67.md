Write a python function to find the nth occurrence of a specific character in a string.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Here's a Python function that finds the nth occurrence of a specific character in a string:

```python
def find_nth_occurrence(character, string, n):
    count = 0
    for index, char in enumerate(string):
        if char == character:
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return index
    return -1

# Example usage:
string = "hello world, how are you?"
character = 'o'
n = 3
result = find_nth_occurrence(character, string, n)
print(f"The {n}rd occurrence of '{character}' is at index {result}.")
```

This function takes three arguments: the character you want to find, the string in which you want to find the character, and the occurrence number (n). It iterates through the string, keeping track of the occurrences of the character. When the nth occurrence is found, it returns the index of that occurrence. If the character does not occur n times in the string, the function returns -1.

**Finding the Nth Occurrence of a Character in a String**

The following Python function finds the position of the nth occurrence of a specific character in a given string.

### Code

```python
def find_nth_occurrence(string, char, n):
    """
    Find the position of the nth occurrence of a character in a string.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.
        char (str): The character to search for.
        n (int): The occurrence number.

    Returns:
        int: The position of the nth occurrence. Returns -1 if not found.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is less than 1.
    """

    # Check if n is a positive integer
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")

    # Initialize a counter for occurrences
    count = 0

    # Iterate over the string
    for i, c in enumerate(string):
        # Check if the current character matches the target character
        if c == char:
            # Increment the occurrence counter
            count += 1
            # If this is the nth occurrence, return its position
            if count == n:
                return i

    # If the loop completes without finding the nth occurrence, return -1
    return -1
```

### Example Use Cases

```python
# Example 1: Find the 3rd occurrence of 'a'
print(find_nth_occurrence("banana", 'a', 3))  # Output: 3

# Example 2: Find the 2nd occurrence of 'b'
print(find_nth_occurrence("banana", 'b', 2))  # Output: 3

# Example 3: Find the 1st occurrence of 'c' (not found)
print(find_nth_occurrence("banana", 'c', 1))  # Output: -1

# Example 4: Invalid input (n is not a positive integer)
try:
    print(find_nth_occurrence("banana", 'a', 0))
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: n must be a positive integer
```

This function iterates over the string, counting occurrences of the target character. It returns the position of the nth occurrence. If the character is not found `n` times, it returns -1.
