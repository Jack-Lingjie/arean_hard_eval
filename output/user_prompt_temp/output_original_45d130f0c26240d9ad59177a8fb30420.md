Explain Depth first search using code snippet(python) in a detail way possible

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack data structure. Here, I'll explain the DFS algorithm using a recursive approach in Python.

Let's start with a simple representation of a graph using a dictionary where the keys represent the nodes and the values are lists of adjacent nodes.

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
```

Now, let's implement the DFS algorithm:

```python
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    # Mark the current node as visited
    visited[node] = True
    print(node, end=' ')

    # Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
    for i in graph[node]:
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs(graph, i, visited)

# Driver code
# Declare an empty dictionary to store the visited status of each node
visited = {node: False for node in graph}

# Call the DFS function starting from the first vertex
dfs(graph, 'A', visited)
```

In the `dfs` function, we first mark the current node as visited and print it. Then, we iterate through all adjacent nodes of the current node. If an adjacent node is not visited, we call the `dfs` function recursively for that node.

When you run this code, you'll get the following output:

```
A B D E F C
```

This output represents the order in which the nodes are visited using the DFS algorithm. Note that the actual output may vary depending on the order of nodes in the adjacency list.

In summary, the Depth First Search algorithm is a way to traverse a graph by exploring as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. The Python code snippet provided demonstrates a simple implementation of the DFS algorithm using a recursive approach.

**Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph or tree by visiting a node and then visiting all of its neighbors before backtracking.

**How DFS Works**
-----------------

1. **Choose a Starting Node**: Select a node in the graph to start the traversal.
2. **Visit the Node**: Mark the node as visited.
3. **Explore Neighbors**: Recursively visit all unvisited neighbors of the current node.
4. **Backtrack**: When all neighbors have been visited, backtrack to the previous node.

**Python Code Snippet**
----------------------

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.adjacency_list = {}

    def add_edge(self, node1, node2):
        """Add an edge between two nodes."""
        if node1 not in self.adjacency_list:
            self.adjacency_list[node1] = []
        if node2 not in self.adjacency_list:
            self.adjacency_list[node2] = []
        self.adjacency_list[node1].append(node2)
        self.adjacency_list[node2].append(node1)

    def dfs(self, start_node):
        """
        Perform a Depth-First Search traversal.

        Args:
            start_node (str): The node to start the traversal.

        Returns:
            list: A list of visited nodes in the order they were visited.
        """
        visited = set()
        traversal_order = []

        def dfs_helper(node):
            visited.add(node)
            traversal_order.append(node)
            for neighbor in self.adjacency_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    dfs_helper(neighbor)

        dfs_helper(start_node)
        return traversal_order


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = Graph()
    graph.add_edge("A", "B")
    graph.add_edge("A", "C")
    graph.add_edge("B", "D")
    graph.add_edge("C", "E")

    start_node = "A"
    traversal_order = graph.dfs(start_node)
    print(f"DFS Traversal Order: {traversal_order}")
```

**Explanation**
---------------

1. **Graph Class**: The `Graph` class represents a graph using an adjacency list.
2. **`add_edge` Method**: Adds an edge between two nodes.
3. **`dfs` Method**:
	* **`visited` Set**: Keeps track of visited nodes.
	* **`traversal_order` List**: Stores the order of visited nodes.
	* **`dfs_helper` Function**: Recursively visits neighbors of a node.
4. **Example Usage**: Creates a graph, adds edges, and performs a DFS traversal.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown**
---------------------------

1. **Create a Graph**: Initialize an empty graph.
2. **Add Edges**: Connect nodes using the `add_edge` method.
3. **Choose a Starting Node**: Select a node to start the traversal.
4. **Perform DFS**: Call the `dfs` method with the starting node.
5. **Get Traversal Order**: Retrieve the list of visited nodes.

**Tips and Variations**
-----------------------

*   Use a stack data structure to implement DFS.
*   Modify the algorithm to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal.
*   Implement DFS on a weighted graph by using a priority queue.
