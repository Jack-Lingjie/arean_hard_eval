I am migrating from MacOS Mojave running Safari 14 to a new Mac running Safari 17 under MacOS Sonoma. I want Safari on my new Mac to automatically open with all the tabs open on my old Mac. Note that Safari 14 does not support iCloud tabs, and that I do *not* want to have to manually open each tab as I have hundreds of them!

To transfer your open tabs from Safari 14 on your old Mac to Safari 17 on your new Mac, you can follow these steps:

1. On your old Mac, open Safari 14.
2. Click on "File" in the menu bar and choose "Export Bookmarks."
3. Save the exported bookmarks file (e.g., "Safari Bookmarks.html") to a location you can easily access, such as your Desktop or a USB drive.

4. Transfer the exported bookmarks file to your new Mac. You can do this using a USB drive, AirDrop, or any other file transfer method you prefer.

5. On your new Mac, open Safari 17.
6. Click on "File" in the menu bar and choose "Import From" > "Bookmarks HTML File."
7. Locate and select the exported bookmarks file (e.g., "Safari Bookmarks.html") that you transferred from your old Mac.
8. Click "Import" to import the bookmarks into Safari 17 on your new Mac.

Now, you should see a new folder in your Safari 17 bookmarks called "Imported" or "Imported Bookmarks." This folder will contain all the bookmarks from your old Mac, including the open tabs.

To open all the tabs at once:

1. In Safari 17, click on "Bookmarks" in the menu bar and choose "Show Bookmarks."
2. Locate the "Imported" or "Imported Bookmarks" folder in the sidebar.
3. Right-click (or Control-click) on the folder and choose "Open in New Tabs."

This will open all the bookmarks from your old Mac, including the open tabs, in new tabs in Safari 17 on your new Mac.
