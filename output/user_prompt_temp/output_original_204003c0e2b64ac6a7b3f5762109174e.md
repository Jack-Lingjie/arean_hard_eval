Write a python function that solves a quadratic equation.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Here's a Python function that solves a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0 using the quadratic formula:

```python
import cmath

def solve_quadratic(a, b, c):
    # Calculate the discriminant
    discriminant = cmath.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)

    # Find two solutions
    sol1 = (-b - discriminant) / (2 * a)
    sol2 = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)

    return (sol1, sol2)

# Example usage:
a = 1
b = -3
c = 2
solutions = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)
print(f"The solutions are {solutions[0]} and {solutions[1]}")
```

This function uses the `cmath` module to handle complex numbers, so it will work even if the discriminant is negative.

**Solving a Quadratic Equation in Python**

### Overview

The following function solves a quadratic equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. It uses the quadratic formula to find the roots.

### Code

```python
import math

def solve_quadratic(a, b, c):
    """
    Solves a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

    Args:
        a (float): Coefficient of x^2.
        b (float): Coefficient of x.
        c (float): Constant term.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the two roots of the equation.
    """

    # Calculate the discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

    # Check if the equation has real roots
    if discriminant < 0:
        raise ValueError("The equation has no real roots.")

    # Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula
    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

    return root1, root2

# Example usage:
a = 1
b = -3
c = 2

try:
    root1, root2 = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)
    print(f"The roots are {root1} and {root2}.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

### Explanation

- **Function Signature**: The function `solve_quadratic` takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.
- **Discriminant Calculation**: The discriminant is calculated as `b^2 - 4ac`. This value determines the nature of the roots.
- **Real Roots Check**: If the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real roots, and a `ValueError` is raised.
- **Root Calculation**: The roots are calculated using the quadratic formula: `(-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`.
- **Example Usage**: The function is called with example coefficients `a=1`, `b=-3`, and `c=2`. The roots are then printed. If the equation has no real roots, an error message is displayed.
