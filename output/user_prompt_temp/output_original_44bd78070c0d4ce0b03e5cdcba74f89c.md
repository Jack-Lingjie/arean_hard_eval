Write me an iMessage extension that displays two buttons in the keyboard view.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To create an iMessage extension with two buttons in the keyboard view, follow these steps:

1. Open Xcode and create a new project.
2. Select "iMessage Application" as the template and click "Next."
3. Enter your project name, organization identifier, and other details, then click "Next."
4. Choose a location to save your project and click "Create."

Now, let's add two buttons to the keyboard view:

1. In the Project Navigator, expand the "MessageExtension" folder and open "MainInterface.storyboard."
2. In the Object Library, search for "Button" and drag two buttons onto the view.
3. Position the buttons as desired within the view.
4. To create constraints for the buttons, select a button, click the "Add New Constraints" button at the bottom-right corner of the storyboard, and set the constraints for the button's position. Repeat this step for the second button.

Next, let's create actions for the buttons:

1. Open the "Assistant Editor" by clicking the "Assistant" button in the top-right corner of Xcode.
2. In the Assistant Editor, open "MessagesViewController.swift."
3. Control-drag from the first button to the "MessagesViewController" class in the Assistant Editor to create an action. Name the action "firstButtonTapped" and click "Connect."
4. Control-drag from the second button to the "MessagesViewController" class in the Assistant Editor to create another action. Name the action "secondButtonTapped" and click "Connect."

Now, you can add your desired functionality to the "firstButtonTapped" and "secondButtonTapped" functions in "MessagesViewController.swift."

Here's an example of how your "MessagesViewController.swift" file should look:

```swift
import UIKit
import Messages

class MessagesViewController: MSMessagesAppViewController {
    
    @IBAction func firstButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        // Add your desired functionality for the first button here
    }
    
    @IBAction func secondButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        // Add your desired functionality for the second button here
    }
    
    // The rest of the default code for MessagesViewController
}
```

Now you have an iMessage extension with two buttons in the keyboard view. You can customize the appearance and functionality of the buttons as needed.

**Creating an iMessage Extension**

To create an iMessage extension that displays two buttons in the keyboard view, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up the Project

1. **Open Xcode**: Start by opening Xcode on your Mac.
2. **Create a New Project**: Choose "App" under the "iOS" section.
3. **Select the Template**: Choose "Message Extension" under the "Message" section.
4. **Name Your Project**: Name your project, for example, "IMessageExtension."

### Step 2: Design the User Interface

1. **Open the Storyboard**: Open the `Main.storyboard` file.
2. **Drag and Drop**: Drag a `UIStackView` from the Object Library into the view controller.
3. **Add Buttons**: Drag two `UIButton` instances into the `UIStackView`.
4. **Configure the Stack View**:
   - Select the `UIStackView`.
   - Go to the Attributes Inspector.
   - Set `Axis` to `Vertical`.
   - Set `Alignment` to `Fill`.
   - Set `Distribution` to `Fill Equally`.

### Step 3: Implement Button Actions

1. **Open the Code**: Open the `ViewController.swift` file.
2. **Add Button Actions**:
   - Implement the `action` methods for each button.

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var stackView: UIStackView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    @IBAction func button1Pressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
        // Handle button 1 press
        print("Button 1 pressed")
    }

    @IBAction func button2Pressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
        // Handle button 2 press
        print("Button 2 pressed")
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Extension

1. **Run the App**: Run the app on a physical device or simulator.
2. **Test the Extension**: Open Messages and start a conversation.
3. **Tap the App Icon**: Tap the app icon to display the keyboard extension.

### Example Use Case

This iMessage extension can be used to:

- **Send Quick Responses**: Display two buttons for quick responses, such as "Yes" and "No."
- **Share Content**: Allow users to share content, like a link or a photo, with a single tap.

### Code Explanation

This code creates a basic iMessage extension with two buttons. The `UIStackView` is used to evenly distribute the buttons vertically. The `@IBAction` methods handle the button presses.

### Advice

- **Test Thoroughly**: Test the extension on different devices and in various scenarios.
- **Customize Appearance**: Customize the appearance of the extension to match your app's branding.
- **Implement Additional Features**: Implement additional features, such as sharing content or sending quick responses.
