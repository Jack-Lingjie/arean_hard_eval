I am not a tax professional, but I can provide you with some general information that you may find helpful. If you want to move your trading activities to a company, you might consider creating a limited liability company (GmbH) in Germany. This type of company is commonly used for small and medium-sized businesses and offers limited liability protection for its owners.

In Germany, the corporate tax rate for a GmbH is generally around 15%, plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the corporate tax, and trade tax, which varies depending on the municipality. The effective tax rate for a GmbH can range between 30% and 33%, depending on the location of the company.

However, you should also consider the tax implications of transferring your trading activities to a company, as well as the ongoing compliance and administrative requirements associated with operating a company. It is essential to consult with a tax advisor or attorney who specializes in German tax law to ensure that you are making the best decision for your specific situation and to help you navigate the process of setting up and managing a company.

As for setting up a company in another country, this may be an option, but it is important to consider the tax implications and regulations in both Germany and the country where you establish the company. You should consult with a tax advisor or attorney who is familiar with international tax law to help you determine the best course of action.
