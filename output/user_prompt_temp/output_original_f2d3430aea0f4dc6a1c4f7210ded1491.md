Based on the information provided, I will compare the two investment options for you:

1. Buying a flat:
- Initial investment: 90 lakhs
- Loan amount: 80 lakhs
- EMI: 80,000 per month for 15 years
- Rent after 2 years: 20,000-30,000 per month
- Annual repair cost: 30,000
- Annual maintenance cost: 60,000 (if not rented)
- Expected value after 10 years: 2.5x (225 lakhs)
- Capital gains tax: 20%

2. SIP in mutual funds:
- Initial investment: 90 lakhs
- Monthly investment: 1 lakh in large cap, 1 lakh in small cap, 1 lakh in mid cap
- Expected growth rates: 7-8% for large cap, 15-20% for small cap, 10-15% for mid cap
- Capital gains tax: 10%

It is difficult to predict the exact returns from both options, as they depend on various factors such as market conditions, interest rates, and property appreciation. However, here's a rough comparison:

1. Buying a flat:
- After 10 years, the flat's value might be 225 lakhs.
- Capital gains: 135 lakhs (225 - 90)
- Capital gains tax: 27 lakhs (20% of 135)
- Net gain: 108 lakhs (135 - 27)

2. SIP in mutual funds:
- Assuming an average annual return of 10% (considering the mix of large, mid, and small-cap funds), your investment could grow to approximately 270 lakhs after 10 years.
- Capital gains: 180 lakhs (270 - 90)
- Capital gains tax: 18 lakhs (10% of 180)
- Net gain: 162 lakhs (180 - 18)

Based on this rough comparison, investing in mutual funds through SIP seems to be a better option, as it offers higher potential returns and lower capital gains tax. However, it's essential to consider your risk tolerance and investment goals before making a decision. It's also a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

**Investment Options**

There are two primary investment options:

1. **Buying a Flat:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Potential long-term appreciation in property value.
     - Rental income after a 2-year construction period.
   - **Cons:**
     - High initial investment.
     - Ongoing expenses (EMI, maintenance, repairs).
     - Risk of tenants damaging the property.

2. **SIP in Mutual Funds:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Lower initial investment.
     - Potential for higher returns over the long term.
     - Liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Cons:**
     - Market volatility.
     - Risk of losses.

**Key Considerations**

- **Time Horizon:** Both options have a 10-year time frame.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Buying a flat involves more risk due to market fluctuations and potential tenant issues.
- **Financial Goals:** The goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

**Calculations**

- **Buying a Flat:**
  - **Initial Investment:** ₹80 lakhs (after taking a loan).
  - **Potential Returns:**
    - After 5-6 years: ₹160 lakhs.
    - After 10 years: ₹200 lakhs.
  - **Tax Implications:** 20% capital gains tax.

- **SIP in Mutual Funds:**
  - **Monthly Investment:** ₹3 lakhs.
  - **Potential Returns:**
    - Large Cap Funds: 7-8% per annum.
    - Small Cap Funds: 15-20% in good years, -15% to -30% in bad years.
    - Mid Cap Funds: 10-15% in good years, -10% to -15% in bad years.
  - **Tax Implications:** 10% capital gains tax.

**Recommendation**

- **Buying a Flat:** This option involves significant upfront costs and ongoing expenses. It may not be the most efficient use of funds, especially considering the potential returns from SIPs.

- **SIP in Mutual Funds:** This option offers more flexibility and potential for higher returns. It also allows for diversification across different asset classes.

**Conclusion**

Given the considerations and potential returns, investing in SIPs across large cap, small cap, and mid cap funds might be a more efficient and less risky option. This approach allows for diversification and potentially higher returns over the long term.
