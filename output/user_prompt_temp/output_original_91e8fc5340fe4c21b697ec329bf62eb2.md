I have a set of examples (that is assignments of $n$ variables $x_1 ... x_n$ that are labeled as solution (+) or non-solution (-). The goal is to find the minimum subset of variables in  $x_1 ... x_n$  such that it is possible to split between (+) and (-) by seeing only theses variables.

To find the minimum subset of variables that can split between (+) and (-) examples, you can use a feature selection technique. One such technique is called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). Here's a step-by-step guide to applying RFE:

1. Start with the full set of variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$.
2. Train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, etc.) on the examples using all the variables.
3. Evaluate the importance of each variable in the classifier. This can be done using the coefficients of the logistic regression or the feature importances of a decision tree.
4. Remove the least important variable from the set.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach a desired number of variables or the performance of the classifier starts to degrade significantly.

At the end of this process, you will have a subset of variables that can effectively split between (+) and (-) examples. The minimum subset of variables is the one that provides the best trade-off between the number of variables and the classification performance.

Keep in mind that the choice of classifier and the evaluation metric can affect the results. It's a good idea to experiment with different classifiers and metrics to find the best subset of variables for your specific problem.

**Minimum Subset of Variables**

You have a set of examples with assignments of $n$ variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$. Each example is labeled as a solution (+) or non-solution (-). The goal is to find the minimum subset of variables such that it is possible to distinguish between (+) and (-) by observing only these variables.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify Key Variables**:
   - Start by examining each variable's impact on distinguishing between (+) and (-) examples.

2. **Construct a Decision Tree**:
   - Create a decision tree where each internal node represents a variable.
   - Each leaf node represents a class label (+ or -).

3. **Prune the Tree**:
   - Remove any branches that do not contribute to the decision-making process.

4. **Extract the Minimum Subset**:
   - The minimum subset of variables is the set of variables that appear in the pruned decision tree.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have the following examples:

| $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | Label |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | -    |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | +    |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | -    |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | +    |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | -    |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | +    |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | -    |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | +    |

### Code Implementation

```python
import pandas as pd

# Define the data
data = {
    'x1': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    'x2': [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    'x3': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    'label': [-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Initialize an empty list to store the minimum subset
min_subset = []

# Iterate over each column in the DataFrame
for col in df.columns:
    # If the column is not 'label'
    if col != 'label':
        # Calculate the information gain
        info_gain = calculate_info_gain(df, col)
        
        # If the information gain is greater than 0
        if info_gain > 0:
            # Add the column to the minimum subset
            min_subset.append(col)

# Print the minimum subset
print(min_subset)
```

### Explanation

This code snippet demonstrates how to find the minimum subset of variables required to distinguish between (+) and (-) examples.

- It starts by defining the data in a dictionary format.
- The data is then converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
- An empty list `min_subset` is initialized to store the minimum subset of variables.
- The code iterates over each column in the DataFrame (excluding the 'label' column).
- For each column, it calculates the information gain using the `calculate_info_gain` function.
- If the information gain is greater than 0, the column is added to the `min_subset`.
- Finally, the minimum subset of variables is printed.

### Note

The `calculate_info_gain` function is not implemented here. It should calculate the information gain for each column based on the class labels.
