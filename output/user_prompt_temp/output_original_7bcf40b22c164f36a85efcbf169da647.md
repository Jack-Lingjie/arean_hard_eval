<|User Prompt|>
I have a Python script that scrapes a webpage using Playwright. Now I want to start ten instances of that script in parallel on one AWS EC2 instance, but so that each script binds to a different IP address. How can I do that with Terraform?

To achieve this, you can use Terraform to create an AWS EC2 instance and configure it with the necessary software and scripts. However, Terraform itself cannot directly run multiple instances of your Python script with different IP addresses. You'll need to use a proxy service to achieve the desired IP binding.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you need to follow:

1. Set up a proxy service with multiple IP addresses. You can use a service like ProxyMesh, ScraperAPI, or create your own proxy server using Squid.

2. Modify your Python script to use the proxy service. You can use a library like `httpx` to send requests through the proxy.

3. Create a Terraform configuration file to set up an AWS EC2 instance and install the necessary software (Python, Playwright, etc.).

4. Use a tool like `tmux` or `screen` to run multiple instances of your Python script in parallel on the EC2 instance.

Here's a sample Terraform configuration file to create an EC2 instance and install the required software:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Amazon Linux 2 LTS
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  key_name = "your_key_pair_name"

  tags = {
    Name = "web-scraper"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              sudo yum update -y
              sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y python3.8
              sudo yum install -y tmux
              sudo pip3 install playwright httpx
              sudo python3 -m playwright install
              aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket/your-script.py /home/ec2-user/your-script.py
              chown ec2-user:ec2-user /home/ec2-user/your-script.py
              chmod +x /home/ec2-user/your-script.py
              EOF
}
```

Replace `your_key_pair_name` with your actual key pair name, and replace the S3 bucket and object paths with the correct paths to your Python script.

After applying the Terraform configuration, SSH into the EC2 instance and use `tmux` or `screen` to run multiple instances of your Python script in parallel. For example, using `tmux`:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  tmux new-session -d -s "scraper-$i" "python3 /home/ec2-user/your-script.py"
done
```

This will start 10 instances of your script in separate `tmux` sessions. You can attach to any session using `tmux attach-session -t scraper-1` (replace `1` with the desired session number).

Remember to modify your Python script to use the proxy service with different IP addresses for each instance.

**Running Multiple Playwright Instances in Parallel on an AWS EC2 Instance**

To achieve this, you'll need to:

1. **Create an EC2 instance** with multiple IP addresses.
2. **Use Terraform to manage the instance** and run the Playwright script in parallel.

### Step 1: Create an EC2 instance with multiple IP addresses

To create an EC2 instance with multiple IP addresses, you'll need to:

- **Create a new VPC** with multiple subnets.
- **Launch an EC2 instance** in each subnet.

### Step 2: Use Terraform to manage the instance and run the Playwright script

**`main.tf`**:

```hcl
# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create a new VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

# Create multiple subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  count             = 10
  cidr_block        = "10.0.${count.index}.0/24"
  availability_zone = "${element(split(",", var.azs), count.index % length(var.azs))}"
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.example.id
}

# Create an EC2 instance in each subnet
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count         = 10
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c71c99" # Ubuntu 20.04
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = element(aws_subnet.example.*.id, count.index)
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.example.id]
}

# Create a security group
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name        = "example-sg"
  description = "Allow inbound traffic on port 22"

  # Allow inbound traffic on port 22
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Run the Playwright script in parallel
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  count = 10

  # Execute the Playwright script
  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    host        = self.public_ip
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/your_private_key")
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "python /path/to/your/script.py",
    ]
  }
}
```

**`variables.tf`**:

```hcl
variable "azs" {
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
}
```

**`terraform init`** and **`terraform apply`** to create the resources.

This setup creates an EC2 instance in each subnet and runs the Playwright script in parallel using `null_resource`. Each instance binds to a different IP address.

**Note**: Replace `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual path to your Playwright script. Also, ensure you have the necessary permissions to create resources in your AWS account.
