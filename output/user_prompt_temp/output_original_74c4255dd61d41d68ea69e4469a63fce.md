<|User Prompt|>
I need to connect a list of FBIDs found in support tickets (the dim_tier1_job_final table) to a list of page IDs found in a target list. Unfortunately, our support tickets typically don't include a page ID. How can I connect these two lists of data in Daiquery?

To connect the two lists of data in Daiquery, you can use a JOIN operation. Since the support tickets don't include a page ID, you'll need to find a common field between the two tables that can be used to join them. Let's assume there's a common field called "user_id" in both tables. Here's a sample Daiquery SQL query to connect the two lists:

```sql
SELECT
  t1.FBID,
  t2.page_id
FROM
  dim_tier1_job_final AS t1
JOIN
  target_list AS t2
ON
  t1.user_id = t2.user_id;
```

Replace "user_id" with the appropriate common field if it's different. This query will join the dim_tier1_job_final table (t1) with the target_list table (t2) based on the common field (user_id) and return the FBID and page_id columns in the result.

If there's no direct common field between the two tables, you might need to join them through an intermediate table that has relationships with both tables. In that case, you would perform a multi-step join using the intermediate table.

**Connecting FBIDs to Page IDs in Daiquery**

To connect the list of FBIDs from the `dim_tier1_job_final` table to the list of page IDs in the target list, you can use a **left join** or a **subquery**. Here are both approaches:

### **Method 1: Using a Left Join**

```sql
SELECT 
  djf.fb_id,
  tp.page_id
FROM 
  dim_tier1_job_final djf
LEFT JOIN 
  target_pages tp ON djf.fb_id = tp.fb_id;
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - This query joins the `dim_tier1_job_final` table (`djf`) with the `target_pages` table (`tp`) on the `fb_id` column.
  - The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all records from `dim_tier1_job_final` are included, even if there are no matches in `target_pages`.

### **Method 2: Using a Subquery**

```sql
SELECT 
  djf.fb_id,
  tp.page_id
FROM 
  dim_tier1_job_final djf
INNER JOIN 
  (
    SELECT 
      fb_id 
    FROM 
      target_pages
  ) tp ON djf.fb_id = tp.fb_id;
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - This query uses a subquery to select the `fb_id` from the `target_pages` table.
  - It then joins this subquery with the `dim_tier1_job_final` table on the `fb_id` column.

### **Choosing the Right Method**

- **Left Join**: Use when you want to include all records from `dim_tier1_job_final`, even if there are no matches in `target_pages`.
- **Subquery**: Use when you want to ensure that only matching records are included.

### **Example Use Case**

Suppose you have the following data:

**`dim_tier1_job_final`**

| fb_id |
| --- |
| 123   |
| 456   |
| 789   |

**`target_pages`**

| page_id | fb_id |
| --- | --- |
| 1      | 123   |
| 2      | 456   |

**Query Result**

| fb_id | page_id |
| --- | --- |
| 123   | 1      |
| 456   | 2      |

This result shows the matched `fb_id` from `dim_tier1_job_final` with the corresponding `page_id` from `target_pages`.
