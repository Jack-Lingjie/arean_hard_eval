What are the solutions of 5 x^2 + 3 x^2 = 8? If x is the length of a line segment what is x?

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
First, let's simplify the equation:

5x^2 + 3x^2 = 8x^2

Now, we have:

8x^2 = 8

To solve for x, divide both sides by 8:

x^2 = 1

Now, take the square root of both sides:

x = Â±1

So, the solutions for x are 1 and -1. However, since x represents the length of a line segment, we can only consider the positive value. Therefore, the length of the line segment is x = 1.

**Solving the Equation**

The given equation is:
\[5x^2 + 3x^2 = 8\]

Combining like terms:
\[8x^2 = 8\]

Dividing both sides by 8:
\[x^2 = 1\]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[x = \pm 1\]

**Interpretation**

If \(x\) represents the length of a line segment, it can be either positive or negative. However, in the context of length, negative values are not applicable.

Therefore, the length of the line segment is **1** unit.
