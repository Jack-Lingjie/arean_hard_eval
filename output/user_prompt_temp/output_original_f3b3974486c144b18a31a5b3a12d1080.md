<|User Prompt|>
I am a python programmer and I want to create a program that will use a list of about 50,000 records with about 12 fields per record.  I would like to search arbitrary text files for occurrences of these fields from this list of records so that the program can assign a value that represents the probability the text file being searched corresponds to a record in the list.
for instance: 
If one of the records contains these 12 fields: Jim, McMillan, Southpointe, Discover, Hoover, 35244, 242355, 6011546511247784, 10/19/1972, 593647757, 7203354, 205-422-1680
It would search a text file for occurrences of these fields and assign a point value based upon the number of matching fields found.  If each of these fields were worth 1 point most text files scanned would have zero points but some documents would have up to 12.  The program should return the text document scores above a specified threshold. 
Keep this design elegant but simple, take a deep breath, think step by step and if you do a good job I will tip you $200!

To create this program, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the list of records from a file or any other source.
2. Create a function to search for the fields in a text file and calculate the score.
3. Iterate through all the text files you want to search and apply the function.
4. Filter the results based on the specified threshold.
5. Display or save the results.

Here's a simple implementation in Python:

```python
import os
import re

# Read the list of records
def read_records(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        records = [line.strip().split(',') for line in file.readlines()]
    return records

# Calculate the score for a text file
def calculate_score(text, record):
    score = 0
    for field in record:
        if field in text:
            score += 1
    return score

# Search for fields in a text file and calculate the score
def search_text_file(file_path, records, threshold):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

    results = []
    for record in records:
        score = calculate_score(text, record)
        if score >= threshold:
            results.append((file_path, score))

    return results

# Main function
def main(records_file, text_files_dir, threshold):
    records = read_records(records_file)
    results = []

    for file_name in os.listdir(text_files_dir):
        file_path = os.path.join(text_files_dir, file_name)
        if os.path.isfile(file_path):
            results.extend(search_text_file(file_path, records, threshold))

    results.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return results

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    records_file = 'records.txt'
    text_files_dir = 'text_files'
    threshold = 3

    results = main(records_file, text_files_dir, threshold)
    for result in results:
        print(f"File: {result[0]}, Score: {result[1]}")
```

Replace 'records.txt' with the path to your records file and 'text_files' with the path to the directory containing the text files you want to search. Adjust the threshold value as needed.

This implementation assumes that the records file has one record per line, with fields separated by commas. You can modify the `read_records` function to read records from any other format or source.

**Program Design: Text File Scoring**

To create a program that scores text files based on their relevance to a list of records, follow these steps:

### Step 1: **Data Preparation**

- **Record List**: Store the list of 50,000 records in a Python dictionary or a CSV file for easier management.
- **Text File**: Prepare the text files to be searched.

### Step 2: **Program Structure**

- **`record_list.py`**: Define the list of records.
- **`text_scoring.py`**: Implement the text scoring logic.

### Step 3: **Text Scoring Logic**

#### `text_scoring.py`

```python
import re
from typing import Dict

def load_records(record_file: str) -> Dict:
    """Load records from a CSV file."""
    records = {}
    with open(record_file, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            fields = line.strip().split(',')
            records[fields[0]] = fields[1:]  # Assuming the first field is the key
    return records

def score_text_file(text_file: str, records: Dict, threshold: int) -> Dict:
    """Score a text file based on its relevance to the records."""
    scores = {}
    with open(text_file, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
        for record_id, fields in records.items():
            score = sum(1 for field in fields if re.search(field, text, re.IGNORECASE))
            scores[record_id] = score
    return {record_id: score for record_id, score in scores.items() if score >= threshold}

def main():
    record_file = 'records.csv'  # Replace with your record file
    text_file = 'document.txt'   # Replace with your text file
    threshold = 5                 # Adjust the threshold as needed

    records = load_records(record_file)
    scores = score_text_file(text_file, records, threshold)

    print(scores)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Step 4: **Example Use Case**

- **`records.csv`**:

  ```
  Jim,McMillan,Southpointe,Discover,Hoover,35244,242355,6011546511247784,10/19/1972,593647757,7203354,205-422-1680
  ```

- **`document.txt`**:

  ```
  Jim McMillan lives at Southpointe. He has a Discover card.
  ```

- **`main.py`**:

  ```python
  from text_scoring import main

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
  ```

### Step 5: **Run the Program**

- Run `main.py` to execute the program.

This design is elegant and simple. The program loads records from a CSV file, scores text files based on their relevance to the records, and returns the scores above a specified threshold.

**Tips**:

- Adjust the `threshold` value as needed.
- Use a more efficient data structure for storing records if the list grows significantly.
- Consider using a database for storing records for better performance.

**Reward**: If you're satisfied with the program's design and implementation, you'll receive a $200 tip.
