<|User Prompt|>
Write a Python function that takes user input as a string, as well as a mapping of variable names to values (both strings) passed as a dict. The function should search the user input string for each variable name specified, and replace them with the variable value. Variables in the input string must be within angle brackets (< and >), and can be no longer than 30 characters. When found, the function should replace the variable name as well as the angle brackets with the variable value. Text that matches a variable name but is not in angle brackets should not be touched. Variables longer than 30 characters in length should not be touched. Function should return the modified string after the variable replacements.

def replace_variables(user_input, variables_mapping):
    for variable_name, variable_value in variables_mapping.items():
        if len(variable_name) <= 30:
            user_input = user_input.replace(f"<{variable_name}>", variable_value)
    return user_input

# Example usage:
user_input = "Hello, my name is <name> and I am <age> years old."
variables_mapping = {"name": "John", "age": "25"}

result = replace_variables(user_input, variables_mapping)
print(result)  # Output: "Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old."

**Variable Replacement Function**
================================

The following Python function replaces variable names in a user input string with their corresponding values.

### Code

```python
import re

def replace_variables(user_input, variables):
    """
    Replaces variable names in the user input string with their corresponding values.

    Args:
        user_input (str): The input string to modify.
        variables (dict): A dictionary mapping variable names to values.

    Returns:
        str: The modified string after variable replacements.
    """

    # Iterate over each variable and its value
    for var, value in variables.items():
        # Check if the variable name is within angle brackets and not longer than 30 characters
        pattern = r'<{}>'.format(re.escape(var))
        if len(var) <= 30:
            # Replace the variable name with its value
            user_input = re.sub(pattern, value, user_input)

    return user_input
```

### Example Use Case

```python
# Define a dictionary of variables and their values
variables = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': '30',
    'city': 'New York'
}

# Get user input
user_input = input("Please enter a string with variables: ")

# Replace variables in the user input
modified_input = replace_variables(user_input, variables)

# Print the modified string
print(modified_input)
```

### Explanation

1.  The function `replace_variables` takes two parameters: `user_input` (the string to modify) and `variables` (a dictionary mapping variable names to values).
2.  It iterates over each variable and its value in the `variables` dictionary.
3.  For each variable, it checks if the variable name is within angle brackets (`<` and `>`) and not longer than 30 characters.
4.  If the variable name meets these conditions, it replaces the variable name with its value using a regular expression substitution.
5.  Finally, the function returns the modified string after all variable replacements.

This function ensures that only variables within angle brackets and not longer than 30 characters are replaced.
