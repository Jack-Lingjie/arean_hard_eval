- Consumable: A single-use cartridge containing the necessary reagents for the detection of sepsis.
- Software: A user interface for the reader that displays the results and manages the data.

2.2 System Workflow
The diagnostic system workflow includes the following steps:
1. Blood sample collection from the patient.
2. Insertion of the blood sample into the consumable cartridge.
3. Insertion of the consumable cartridge into the reader.
4. Analysis of the blood sample by the reader.
5. Display of the results on the software interface.

3. Technical Requirements

- The consumable must comply with the European Union's In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (IVDD).

3.3 Software

3.3.1 Performance
- The software must provide a user-friendly interface for the reader, displaying the results and managing the data.
- The software must be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

3.3.2 Design
- The software must display the results in a clear and concise format, including the patient's information, test results, and interpretation.
- The software must allow for data storage and retrieval, as well as the ability to export data in standard formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).

3.3.3 Security
- The software must comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data.

4. Regulatory Requirements
The diagnostic system must comply with all relevant European Union regulations, including but not limited to:
- Medical Device Directive (MDD) for the reader.
- In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (IVDD) for the consumable.
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the software.

5. Conclusion
This document outlines the technical requirements for a diagnostic system for sepsis detection in European hospital settings. The system must provide rapid, accurate, and reliable results, while complying with all relevant regulations and standards. By meeting these requirements, the diagnostic system will aid healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
