I have flask application in docker container. I read flask config file from file like this: app.config.from_file(config_file, load=json.load)
How to run and say what config to read for docker? Maybe environment variable?

Yes, you can use an environment variable to specify the config file for your Flask application running in a Docker container. Here's how you can do it:

1. Modify your Flask application to read the config file from an environment variable:

```python
import os

config_file = os.environ.get('FLASK_CONFIG_FILE')
if config_file:
    app.config.from_file(config_file, load=json.load)
else:
    # Fallback to a default config file or raise an error
```

2. Update your Dockerfile to set the environment variable:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Set the environment variable for the Flask config file
ENV FLASK_CONFIG_FILE /app/config.json

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

3. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
docker run -p 4000:80 your-image-name
```

If you want to use a different config file, you can override the environment variable when running the container:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:80 -e FLASK_CONFIG_FILE=/app/another_config.json your-image-name
```

This way, you can easily switch between different config files by changing the environment variable value.

To specify the configuration file for your Flask application running in a Docker container, you can use environment variables. Here are a few approaches:

### 1. **Environment Variable**

You can set an environment variable `FLASK_CONFIG_FILE` to the path of your configuration file.

**In your Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# Copy the config file into the container
COPY config.json /app/config.json

# Set the environment variable
ENV FLASK_CONFIG_FILE=/app/config.json
```

**In your `docker run` command:**

```bash
docker run -e FLASK_CONFIG_FILE=/app/config.json your-flask-image
```

### 2. **Using a `.env` File**

Another approach is to use a `.env` file to store your environment variables. This is especially useful when you have multiple environment variables.

**In your Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# Copy the .env file into the container
COPY .env ./

# Set the environment variable
ENV FLASK_CONFIG_FILE=/app/config.json
```

**In your `.env` file:**

```makefile
FLASK_CONFIG_FILE=/app/config.json
```

**In your `docker run` command:**

```bash
docker run -e FLASK_CONFIG_FILE=/app/config.json your-flask-image
```

### 3. **Using Docker Compose**

If you're using Docker Compose, you can specify environment variables directly in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

**In your `docker-compose.yml` file:**

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  flask-app:
    build: .
    environment:
      - FLASK_CONFIG_FILE=/app/config.json
```

### 4. **Configuring Flask**

In your Flask application, you can then read the configuration file using the environment variable.

**In your Flask application:**

```python
import os

config_file = os.environ.get('FLASK_CONFIG_FILE')
app.config.from_file(config_file, load=json.load)
```

By using environment variables, you can easily switch between different configuration files based on your environment.
