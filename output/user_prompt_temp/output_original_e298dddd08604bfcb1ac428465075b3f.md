help me remove column A  based on this code data vertical3;
	set vertical2;
format Treatment $Drug. Effectiveness $Effective. Sex $Sex. ;

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To remove column A (Treatment) from the dataset, you can modify the code as follows:

```sas
data vertical3;
    set vertical2;
    format Effectiveness $Effective. Sex $Sex.;
    drop Treatment;
run;
```

In this code, I added the `drop Treatment;` statement to remove the Treatment column from the dataset.

**Removing a Column from a SAS Dataset**

To remove column A from the `vertical3` dataset, follow these steps:

### Step 1: **Identify the Column to Remove**

- **Column A** is typically the first column in a SAS dataset.

### Step 2: **Use the `DROP` Statement**

- Use the `DROP` statement in the `DATA` step to exclude the column.

### Example Code

```sas
/* 
  Remove column A from the dataset 'vertical3'.
  The 'vertical2' dataset is used as the source.
  Format the variables as specified.
*/

data vertical3;
  set vertical2;
  format 
    Treatment $Drug. 
    Effectiveness $Effective. 
    Sex $Sex. 
  ;
  /* Drop column A */
  drop _A_;
run;
```

### Explanation

- The `DROP` statement is used to exclude the specified column (`_A_`) from the dataset.
- The `format` statement is used to specify the formats for the variables `Treatment`, `Effectiveness`, and `Sex`.
- The `data` step creates a new dataset named `vertical3` based on the `vertical2` dataset.
- The `set` statement specifies the source dataset (`vertical2`) for the new dataset (`vertical3`).

### Note

- The column name is assumed to be `_A_`. If your column name is different, replace `_A_` with your actual column name.
- This code removes the first column from the dataset. If you need to remove a different column, adjust the `DROP` statement accordingly.
