How to achieve multiple rows of data into one row of data in Excel?

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To combine multiple rows of data into one row in Excel, you can use the following methods:

Method 1: Using CONCATENATE function

1. Create a new column where you want to combine the data from multiple rows into one row.
2. In the first cell of the new column, type the formula `=CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1, " ", C1, ...)`, where A1, B1, C1, etc. are the cell references of the data you want to combine. You can add more cell references and use a delimiter (like a space, comma, or any other character) between the cell references to separate the data.
3. Press Enter to apply the formula.
4. Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to apply the formula to the other cells in the column.

Method 2: Using the "&" operator

1. Create a new column where you want to combine the data from multiple rows into one row.
2. In the first cell of the new column, type the formula `=A1 & " " & B1 & " " & C1 & ...`, where A1, B1, C1, etc. are the cell references of the data you want to combine. You can add more cell references and use a delimiter (like a space, comma, or any other character) between the cell references to separate the data.
3. Press Enter to apply the formula.
4. Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to apply the formula to the other cells in the column.

Method 3: Using the TEXTJOIN function (available in Excel 2019 and Office 365)

1. Create a new column where you want to combine the data from multiple rows into one row.
2. In the first cell of the new column, type the formula `=TEXTJOIN(" ", TRUE, A1:C1)`, where " " is the delimiter you want to use between the combined data, TRUE means to ignore empty cells, and A1:C1 is the range of cells you want to combine. You can adjust the range as needed.
3. Press Enter to apply the formula.
4. Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to apply the formula to the other cells in the column.

Remember to replace the cell references and delimiters in the formulas with the appropriate values for your specific data.

**Pivoting Data in Excel**

To transform multiple rows of data into one row of data in Excel, you can use the **PivotTable** feature or the **Power Query** tool. Here are the steps for both methods:

### Method 1: Using PivotTable

1. **Select the Data**:
   - Choose the entire dataset.
2. **Create a PivotTable**:
   - Go to the **"Insert"** tab.
   - Click on **"PivotTable"**.
3. **Configure the PivotTable**:
   - Drag the **column headers** into the **"Row Labels"** and **"Values"** sections.
   - Adjust the **"Values"** section to display the desired data.

### Method 2: Using Power Query

1. **Select the Data**:
   - Choose the entire dataset.
2. **Load to Power Query**:
   - Go to the **"Data"** tab.
   - Click on **"From Table/Range"**.
3. **Transform the Data**:
   - Use the **"Unpivot Columns"** feature to transform the data.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a table with the following structure:

| **Name** | **Year** | **Sales** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| John   | 2020   | 100     |
| John   | 2021   | 120     |
| Jane   | 2020   | 80      |
| Jane   | 2021   | 90      |

**Desired Output**:

| **Name** | **Year** | **2020 Sales** | **2021 Sales** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| John   | 2020   | 100     | 120     |
| Jane   | 2020   | 80      | 90      |

**Using PivotTable**:

1. Select the entire dataset.
2. Go to the **"Insert"** tab and click on **"PivotTable"**.
3. Drag **"Name"** into the **"Row Labels"** section.
4. Drag **"Year"** into the **"Column Labels"** section.
5. Drag **"Sales"** into the **"Values"** section.

**Using Power Query**:

1. Select the entire dataset.
2. Go to the **"Data"** tab and click on **"From Table/Range"**.
3. Use the **"Unpivot Columns"** feature to transform the data.

Both methods will produce the desired output.
