The Akkadian language only had three noun cases: Nominative, Genitive and Accusative. How were indirect objects expressed in Akkadian? Other languages use a Dative case for that but there is no Dative in Akkadian. Can you make an example that has a subject, a direct object and an indirect object? Please also show a word for word interlinear gloss for the example to show the used noun cases.

In Akkadian, indirect objects were often expressed using prepositions, such as "ana" (to, for) or "ina" (in, on), followed by the noun in the genitive case. This construction functioned similarly to the dative case in other languages.

Here's an example sentence with a subject, direct object, and indirect object:

Akkadian: šarrum šapārum ana ilīm šūbû
Interlinear gloss:
šarrum      šapārum      ana      ilīm      šūbû
king-NOM send-ACC to/for god-GEN return-INF

Translation: The king sends the letter to the god.

In this example, "šarrum" (king) is the subject in the nominative case, "šapārum" (letter) is the direct object in the accusative case, and "ilīm" (god) is the indirect object in the genitive case, preceded by the preposition "ana" (to, for).

In Akkadian, indirect objects are expressed using the **Prepositional Phrase** with the particle **"ša"** (meaning "of" or "belonging to"). This is different from languages that use a Dative case.

Here's an example sentence:

**Example Sentence:**  
**šarrum** (king) **ša** **Aššur** (of Aššur) **šulmāt** (peace) **ša** **šarrum** (of the king) **išallak** (will send).

**Word-by-Word Interlinear Gloss:**

1. **šarrum** (Nominative)  
   - **Subject**: The king

2. **ša** (Preposition)  
   - **Indirect Object**: Belonging to

3. **Aššur** (Nominative)  
   - **Indirect Object**: Aššur

4. **šulmāt** (Nominative)  
   - **Direct Object**: Peace

5. **ša** (Preposition)  
   - **Indirect Object**: Belonging to

6. **šarrum** (Genitive)  
   - **Indirect Object**: Of the king

7. **išallak** (Verb)  
   - **Action**: Will send

**Translation:**  
The king of Aššur will send peace to the king.

This example illustrates how Akkadian expresses indirect objects using prepositional phrases with the particle "ša."
