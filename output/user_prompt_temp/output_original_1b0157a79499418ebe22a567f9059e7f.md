<|User Prompt|>
Write a Python function that returns a list of email addresses from a string.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Here's a Python function that uses regular expressions to extract email addresses from a given string:

```python
import re

def extract_emails(s):
    email_pattern = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
    return re.findall(email_pattern, s)

# Example usage:
string = "Please send an email to john.doe@example.com and jane_doe@example.co.uk for more information."
emails = extract_emails(string)
print(emails)
```

This function will output:

```
['john.doe@example.com', 'jane_doe@example.co.uk']
```

Please note that this function may not cover all possible email address formats, but it should work for most common cases.

**Extracting Email Addresses from a String**

The following Python function takes a string as input and returns a list of email addresses found within it.

### Code

```python
import re

def extract_email_addresses(text):
    """
    Extracts email addresses from a given string.

    Args:
        text (str): The input string to search for email addresses.

    Returns:
        list: A list of email addresses found in the input string.
    """
    # Regular expression pattern to match email addresses
    pattern = r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b"

    # Find all matches of the pattern in the input string
    email_addresses = re.findall(pattern, text)

    return email_addresses

# Example usage:
text = "Contact me at john.doe@example.com or jane.smith@example.org for more information."
print(extract_email_addresses(text))
```

### Explanation

- **Importing the `re` Module**: The `re` module provides support for regular expressions in Python.
- **Defining the `extract_email_addresses` Function**:
  - This function takes a string `text` as input.
  - It uses a regular expression pattern to match email addresses.
  - The `re.findall` function is used to find all matches of the pattern in the input string.
  - The function returns a list of email addresses found in the input string.
- **Regular Expression Pattern**:
  - The pattern `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b` matches most common email address formats.
  - It ensures that the matched string is a valid email address by checking for:
    - One or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens (`[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+`).
    - The `@` symbol.
    - One or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens (`[A-Za-z0-9.-]+`).
    - A dot (`\.`).
    - Two or more letters (`[A-Z|a-z]{2,}`).
    - Word boundaries (`\b`) to prevent matching parts of other words.
- **Example Usage**:
  - The example demonstrates how to use the `extract_email_addresses` function with a sample string.
  - It prints the list of email addresses found in the input string.
