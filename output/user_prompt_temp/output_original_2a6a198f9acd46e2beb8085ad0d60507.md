Write sql request to calculate rolling avarage stock for clickhouse table stocks with columns date, article_id, stock_a, stock_b, stock_c

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To calculate the rolling average stock for the ClickHouse table `stocks` with columns `date`, `article_id`, `stock_a`, `stock_b`, and `stock_c`, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
WITH
    window_size AS 3
SELECT
    date,
    article_id,
    avg(stock_a) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN window_size - 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_a,
    avg(stock_b) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN window_size - 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_b,
    avg(stock_c) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN window_size - 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_c
FROM
    stocks
ORDER BY
    date, article_id;
```

This query calculates the rolling average for `stock_a`, `stock_b`, and `stock_c` with a window size of 3. You can change the `window_size` value to any other positive integer to calculate the rolling average with a different window size. The query uses the `PARTITION BY` clause to group the data by `article_id` and the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the data by `date`. The `ROWS BETWEEN` clause specifies the range of rows to include in the rolling average calculation.

**Calculating Rolling Average Stock in ClickHouse**

To calculate the rolling average stock for each article over time, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    article_id,
    stock_a,
    stock_b,
    stock_c,
    AVG(stock_a) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_a,
    AVG(stock_b) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_b,
    AVG(stock_c) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_c
FROM 
    stocks
ORDER BY 
    article_id, date;
```

### Explanation:

- **`PARTITION BY article_id`**: This clause groups the result set by `article_id`, ensuring that the average is calculated separately for each article.
- **`ORDER BY date`**: This clause sorts the rows within each partition by `date`, which is necessary for the window function to operate correctly.
- **`ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`**: This specifies the window over which the average is calculated. In this case, it's the current row and the 7 preceding rows.

### Example Use Case:

Suppose you have a table named `stocks` with the following data:

| date       | article_id | stock_a | stock_b | stock_c |
|------------|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2022-01-01 | 1          | 10      | 20      | 30      |
| 2022-01-02 | 1          | 15      | 25      | 35      |
| 2022-01-03 | 1          | 12      | 22      | 32      |
| 2022-01-04 | 1          | 18      | 28      | 38      |
| 2022-01-05 | 1          | 20      | 30      | 40      |
| 2022-01-06 | 1          | 22      | 32      | 42      |
| 2022-01-07 | 1          | 25      | 35      | 45      |

Running the provided SQL query will return the rolling average stock for each article over the last 7 days.

### Note:

- This query assumes that you want to calculate the rolling average over the last 7 days. Adjust the `ROWS BETWEEN` clause as needed to change the window size.
- Ensure that your ClickHouse version supports window functions.
