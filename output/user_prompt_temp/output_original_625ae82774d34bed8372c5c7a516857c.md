How do you add another IP address on a specific VLAN to a network interface in Linux?

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To add another IP address on a specific VLAN to a network interface in Linux, follow these steps:

1. Install the `vlan` package if it's not already installed. On Debian-based systems, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install vlan
```

On Red Hat-based systems, use:

```
sudo yum install vconfig
```

2. Load the 8021q kernel module to enable VLAN support:

```
sudo modprobe 8021q
```

To make this change persistent across reboots, add `8021q` to `/etc/modules`:

```
echo "8021q" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

3. Create a VLAN interface. Replace `eth0` with your network interface name, `10` with the desired VLAN ID, and `192.168.1.2/24` with the desired IP address and subnet mask:

```
sudo ip link add link eth0 name eth0.10 type vlan id 10
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth0.10
```

4. Bring the VLAN interface up:

```
sudo ip link set eth0.10 up
```

5. To make these changes persistent across reboots, you need to edit the network configuration file. The location of this file depends on your Linux distribution.

For Debian-based systems, edit `/etc/network/interfaces`:

```
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Add the following lines, replacing `eth0`, `10`, and `192.168.1.2/24` with your specific values:

```
auto eth0.10
iface eth0.10 inet static
    address 192.168.1.2
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    vlan-raw-device eth0
```

Save the file and exit the editor. Restart the networking service:

```
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

For Red Hat-based systems, create a new configuration file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.10`:

```
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.10
```

Add the following lines, replacing `eth0`, `10`, and `192.168.1.2` with your specific values:

```
DEVICE=eth0.10
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
IPADDR=192.168.1.2
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
VLAN=yes
```

Save the file and exit the editor. Restart the networking service:

```
sudo systemctl restart network
```

Now you have added another IP address on a specific VLAN to a network interface in Linux.

To add another IP address on a specific VLAN to a network interface in Linux, you can use the following steps:

### 1. **Check the Current Configuration**

First, check the current configuration of your network interface. You can do this by running:

```bash
ip addr show
```

This command will display all the IP addresses assigned to your network interfaces.

### 2. **Add a New IP Address**

To add a new IP address to a specific VLAN on a network interface, use the following command:

```bash
ip addr add <IP_ADDRESS>/<PREFIX_LENGTH> dev <INTERFACE_NAME> brd + vlan <VLAN_ID>
```

- **`<IP_ADDRESS>`**: The IP address you want to add.
- **`<PREFIX_LENGTH>`**: The prefix length of the IP address (e.g., 24 for a /24 subnet).
- **`<INTERFACE_NAME>`**: The name of the network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `eno1`).
- **`<VLAN_ID>`**: The ID of the VLAN you want to add the IP address to.

### 3. **Example**

Here's an example:

```bash
ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0 brd + vlan 100
```

This command adds the IP address `192.168.1.100` with a prefix length of `/24` to the `eth0` interface on VLAN 100.

### 4. **Verify the Configuration**

After adding the new IP address, verify the configuration by running:

```bash
ip addr show
```

This command will display the updated configuration.

### 5. **Save the Configuration**

To save the configuration, use the following command:

```bash
ip -f json flush
```

This command saves the current network configuration.

### 6. **Reboot or Reload the Network**

Finally, reboot your system or reload the network configuration to apply the changes:

```bash
reboot
```

or

```bash
systemctl reload networking
```

This ensures that the new IP address is applied to the network interface.

By following these steps, you can add another IP address on a specific VLAN to a network interface in Linux.
