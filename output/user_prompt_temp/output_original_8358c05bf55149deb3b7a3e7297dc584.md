Here is a Legends of Runeterra deck with Noxus and Freljord regions, featuring Darius from Noxus and Sejuani from Freljord as the champions. These two champions have great synergy, as Darius benefits from aggressive play and Sejuani can help control the board with her Frostbite and Vulnerable effects.

1x Darius (Noxus)
1x Sejuani (Freljord)

Units (27):
3x Omen Hawk (Freljord)

3x Transfusion (Noxus)
2x Culling Strike (Noxus)
3x Fury of the North (Freljord)

This deck focuses on early aggression with low-cost units like Legion Rearguard, Precious Pet, and Ruthless Raider. Mid-game, you can use Trifarian Gloryseeker and Iron Ballista to apply pressure, while Avarosan Hearthguard helps buff your units. Sejuani and Darius can be played in the mid to late game to close out matches.

Use spells like Elixir of Iron, Transfusion, and Fury of the North to protect your units and push for damage. Culling Strike can help remove problematic enemy units.

Remember to adjust the deck according to your playstyle and the cards you have available. Good luck!
