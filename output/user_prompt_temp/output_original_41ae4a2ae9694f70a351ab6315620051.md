<|User Prompt|>
I am trying to prompt an LLM model to extract two dates from a long message. I need help coming up with a prompt that will make the task clear to the model.  Here is what I have so far, I'd like you to suggest ways to improve it please:

    prompt = f"""Determine the rollout date and completion date of the event described in the given message below. 
Most of the time the dates will be under a header that looks something like: '[when will this happen:]'. 
Your answer should be formatted as JSON. ONLY RETURN THIS JSON. It must be in this format:

{json.dumps(date_json)}

Dates should always be formatted in MM/DD/YYYY format, unless you cannot determine one, in which case use 'Unknown'.

If there is no specific day given, as in 'we will begin rolling out in october 2023', just use the first day of the month for the day, so your 
answer would be 10/01/2023.
If you cannot determine a value for 'rollout_date' or 'completion_date', use the value 'Unknown'.
    
Message (delimited by triple quotes):\n\n\"\"\"\n{msg}\n\"\"\" 
"""

Your current prompt is quite detailed, but it can be improved by making it more concise and clear. Here's a revised version of the prompt:

```python
prompt = f"""Extract the rollout date and completion date from the message below. The dates are usually under a header like: '[when will this happen:]'. Provide your answer as a JSON object in this format:

{json.dumps(date_json)}

Dates should be in MM/DD/YYYY format. If a date is not available, use 'Unknown'. If only the month and year are given, use the first day of the month (e.g., 'October 2023' should be '10/01/2023'). If you cannot determine 'rollout_date' or 'completion_date', use 'Unknown'.

Message (delimited by triple quotes):\n\n\"\"\"\n{msg}\n\"\"\" 
"""
```

This revised prompt is more concise and provides clear instructions for the model.

Here's an improved version of your prompt:

```markdown
**Extract Rollout and Completion Dates**

Determine the rollout date and completion date of the event described in the given message.

**Key Details:**

- Dates are often under a header like `[when will this happen:]`.
- The response should be in JSON format.
- Dates must be in the `MM/DD/YYYY` format. If a date cannot be determined, use `'Unknown'`.

**Handling Uncertain Dates:**

- If a specific day is not provided (e.g., "we will begin rolling out in October 2023"), 
  use the first day of the month (e.g., "10/01/2023").

**Message:**

```json
{
  "rollout_date": "Unknown",
  "completion_date": "Unknown"
}
```

**Input Message (triple quotes):**

```markdown
\"\"\"
{msg}
\"\"\`
```

**Expected Output:**

A JSON object with the extracted rollout and completion dates in the `MM/DD/YYYY` format.
```
{
  "rollout_date": "MM/DD/YYYY",
  "completion_date": "MM/DD/YYYY"
}
```

**Example:**

If the input message contains a specific date, the output should look like this:

```json
{
  "rollout_date": "10/01/2023",
  "completion_date": "12/31/2023"
}
```

**Note:** Ensure the input message is provided within the triple quotes.
```
\"\"\"
Your input message here...
\"\"\`
```
```

This revised prompt:

- **Clearly states the task**: Extracting rollout and completion dates.
- **Provides key details**: How to identify dates, the required JSON format, and date formatting.
- **Explains handling uncertain dates**: How to handle cases where specific days are not provided.
- **Includes a sample JSON output**: To guide the model on the expected format.
- **Adds an example**: To demonstrate the desired output.
- **Emphasizes the input format**: Ensuring the input message is provided within triple quotes.
