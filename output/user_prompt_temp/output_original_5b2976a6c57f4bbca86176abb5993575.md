I am expensing airfare costs with my employer, and the reporting software asks me to specify the GST/HST portion of the expense. Reading the invoice for my flight from Toronto, through Montreal, to Las Vegas, I see a base fare (CAD) of 164.99, Total V.A.T/G.S.T/H.S.T. of $15, and Other Taxes of 132.12. The total invoice then sums to 312.11 CAD. I have never seen a bill with 2 tax categories like this and am not sure how the $15 and 132.12 were calculated, and which I should report as GST/HST in my company's expense report. Can you help me better understand how to correctly report the HST on my airfare?

I understand that the invoice breakdown might be confusing. In this case, the Total V.A.T/G.S.T/H.S.T. of $15 is the amount you should report as GST/HST in your company's expense report. This amount represents the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) charged on your airfare.

The Other Taxes of $132.12 likely include various fees and surcharges related to air travel, such as airport improvement fees, security charges, and other government-imposed taxes. These taxes are separate from the GST/HST and should not be included in the GST/HST portion of your expense report.

To summarize, you should report the $15 as the GST/HST portion of your airfare expense.

When expensing airfare costs with your employer, you need to accurately report the GST/HST portion of the expense.

**Breaking Down the Airfare Invoice:**

- **Base Fare (CAD):** This is the initial cost of the flight.
- **Total V.A.T/G.S.T/H.S.T.:** This is the tax applied to the base fare.
- **Other Taxes:** These are additional taxes beyond the GST/HST.

**Calculating the GST/HST:**

- The total invoice is $312.11 CAD.
- The base fare is $164.99 CAD.
- The total V.A.T/G.S.T/H.S.T. is $15 CAD.
- The other taxes are $132.12 CAD.

**Determining the GST/HST Portion:**

- Subtract the base fare and other taxes from the total invoice to find the total tax amount.
- The total tax amount is $312.11 (total invoice) - $164.99 (base fare) - $132.12 (other taxes) = $15.00.

**Reporting the GST/HST:**

- The GST/HST portion of the expense is $15.00.

**Conclusion:**

- The GST/HST portion of the airfare expense is $15.00.
- This amount should be reported in your company's expense report.
