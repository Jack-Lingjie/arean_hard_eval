Here's a contingency table for ingredient combinations with their flavor profiles:

| Ingredient   | Tuna                      | Salt                      | Chocolate                |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Tuna         | Tuna (salty, fishy)       | Tuna + Salt (salty, fishy)| Tuna + Chocolate (unique)|
| Salt         | Tuna + Salt (salty, fishy)| Salt (salty)              | Salt + Chocolate (sweet, salty)|
| Chocolate    | Tuna + Chocolate (unique) | Salt + Chocolate (sweet, salty)| Chocolate (sweet)|

In this table, each cell represents the flavor profile of the ingredient combination. For example, the combination of tuna and salt results in a salty, fishy flavor profile, while the combination of salt and chocolate results in a sweet, salty flavor profile.
