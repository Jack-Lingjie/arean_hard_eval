It seems like the error is caused by the Android NDK not being able to find the `Android.mk` file in the specified path. To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:

1. Double-check the path: Make sure the `Android.mk` file is located at the specified path: `E:\Dhruvin kheni\Backup\Backup\Pancard_pe_loan\Pancard_pe_loan\app\src\main\jni\Android.mk`. If it's not there, move it to the correct location or update the path in the build script.

2. Clean and rebuild the project: Sometimes, cleaning the project and rebuilding it can resolve issues related to the build process. In Android Studio, go to `Build` > `Clean Project`, and then `Build` > `Rebuild Project`.

3. Update the NDK version: If the issue persists, consider updating the Android NDK to the latest version. You can do this by opening the SDK Manager in Android Studio, navigating to the `SDK Tools` tab, and updating the NDK from there.

4. Check for syntax errors: Make sure there are no syntax errors in your `Android.mk` and `Application.mk` files. If there are any errors, fix them and try building the project again.

If you still encounter the error after trying these steps, please provide more information about your project setup and configuration, so I can further assist you.

**Error Analysis**

The error message indicates that the Android NDK is unable to find the `Android.mk` file specified in the `APP_BUILD_SCRIPT` variable.

**Key Points:**

- The `APP_BUILD_SCRIPT` points to an unknown file: `E:\Dhruvin kheni\Backup\Backup\Pancard_pe_loan\Pancard_pe_loan\app\src\main\jni\Android.mk`.
- The error occurs during the C++ build system configuration.

**Solution**

To resolve this issue:

1. **Verify the `Android.mk` File Path**:
   - Ensure the `Android.mk` file exists at the specified path: `E:\Dhruvin kheni\Backup\Backup\Pancard_pe_loan\Pancard_pe_loan\app\src\main\jni\Android.mk`.
   - If the file does not exist, create it.

2. **Check the `Application.mk` File**:
   - Verify that the `Application.mk` file exists at the specified path: `E:\Dhruvin kheni\Backup\Backup\Pancard_pe_loan\Pancard_pe_loan\app\src\main\jni\Application.mk`.
   - If the file does not exist, create it.

3. **Update the `ndk-build` Command**:
   - Ensure the `ndk-build` command is correctly configured to use the `Android.mk` file.

**Example `Android.mk` File**

```makefile
# Android.mk file

# Define the APP_ABI variable
APP_ABI := arm64-v8a

# Define the APP_PLATFORM variable
APP_PLATFORM := android-26

# Define the NDK_APPLICATION_MK variable
NDK_APPLICATION_MK := Application.mk
```

**Example `Application.mk` File**

```makefile
# Application.mk file

# Define the APP_OPTIM variable
APP_OPTIM := debug

# Define the APP_STL variable
APP_STL := c++_shared
```

**Additional Steps**

- Ensure the NDK version is compatible with your project.
- Verify that the `ndk-build` command is correctly configured.
- If the issue persists, try cleaning the project and rebuilding it.
