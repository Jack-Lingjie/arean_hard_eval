Write an ACL config for Tailscale that has three groups in it

nill
family
servers


Everything that is included in the nill group has access to all servers of all three groups on all ports, what is included in the family group has the ability only to use any servers from any groups as exit-nodes, but does not have access to any services on the network servers, the servers group has access to 22/tcp, 80/tcp, 443/tcp to all servers of all three groups, and on other ports and protocols has no access

Here's an ACL config for Tailscale with the three groups you specified:

```
{
  "acls": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:nill"],
      "dst": ["*"]
    },
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:family"],
      "dst": ["*"],
      "ports": ["tailscale:exit-node"]
    },
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:servers"],
      "dst": ["*"],
      "ports": ["22/tcp", "80/tcp", "443/tcp"]
    }
  ],
  "groups": {
    "nill": ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"],
    "family": ["user3@example.com", "user4@example.com"],
    "servers": ["user5@example.com", "user6@example.com"]
  },
  "hosts": {}
}
```

In this configuration, the `nill` group has access to all servers of all three groups on all ports. The `family` group can only use any servers from any groups as exit-nodes, but does not have access to any services on the network servers. The `servers` group has access to 22/tcp, 80/tcp, and 443/tcp to all servers of all three groups, and on other ports and protocols has no access.

Replace the example email addresses in the "groups" section with the actual email addresses of the users you want to include in each group.

**Tailscale ACL Configuration**

The following configuration defines three groups: `nill`, `family`, and `servers`. Each group has specific permissions:

### Group Definitions

```yml
# Define groups
groups:
  - name: nill
    description: Full access to all servers

  - name: family
    description: Exit-node access only

  - name: servers
    description: Limited access to specific ports
```

### Group Permissions

```yml
# Define permissions for each group
permissions:
  - group: nill
    allow:
      - rule: allow all
        from: all
        to: all
        ports: all

  - group: family
    allow:
      - rule: allow exit-node
        from: all
        to: all
        ports: all

  - group: servers
    allow:
      - rule: allow tcp 22,80,443
        from: all
        to: all
        ports: 22,80,443

  - group: servers
    deny:
      - rule: deny all
        from: all
        to: all
        ports: all
        except: tcp 22,80,443
```

### Explanation

- **`nill` Group**: Has full access to all servers on all ports.
- **`family` Group**: Can use any server as an exit node but does not have access to services on network servers.
- **`servers` Group**: Can access ports 22/tcp, 80/tcp, and 443/tcp on all servers. All other ports and protocols are denied.
