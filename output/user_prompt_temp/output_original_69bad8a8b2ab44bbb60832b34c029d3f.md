When using Docker, the `docker build .` command can be used to build an image, assuming you have a Dockerfile in your current directory. How do you undo this build? By this I mean, how do I get back to the spot I was before I ran the `docker build .` command?

You cannot directly "undo" a Docker build, but you can remove the created image to get back to the state before you ran the `docker build .` command. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Find the image ID of the built image. You can do this by running the command:
   ```
   docker images
   ```
   This will list all the images on your system. Locate the image you just built, and note its IMAGE ID.

2. Remove the image using the `docker rmi` command followed by the image ID:
   ```
   docker rmi <IMAGE_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<IMAGE_ID>` with the actual image ID you found in step 1.

By removing the image, you essentially revert to the state before you built the image. However, this does not undo any changes made to the Dockerfile or other files in your project directory.

**Undoing a Docker Build**

To undo a Docker build, you can use the following steps:

### Step 1: **List Running Containers**

First, list all running containers to identify any that might have been created during the build process.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### Step 2: **Stop and Remove Containers**

Stop and remove any containers created during the build. This will help you regain your original state.

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)  # Stop all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)    # Remove all containers
```

### Step 3: **Remove Unnecessary Images**

If the build created any unnecessary images, remove them.

```bash
docker image ls -a  # List all images
docker image rm $(docker image ls -aq)  # Remove all images
```

### Step 4: **Verify Your State**

After completing these steps, verify that your system is back to its original state.

```bash
docker ps -a  # List all containers
docker image ls -a  # List all images
```

By following these steps, you can undo a Docker build and return to your original state.

**Example Use Case**

Suppose you ran `docker build .` and created a container. To undo this:

1. List running containers: `docker ps -a`
2. Stop and remove containers: `docker stop $(docker ps -aq)` and `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`
3. Remove unnecessary images: `docker image rm $(docker image ls -aq)`
4. Verify your state: `docker ps -a` and `docker image ls -a`

This process ensures you regain your original state after undoing a Docker build.
