A package delivery Service will charge 3€ for shipping packages where the sum of the shortest and the longest side of the package must be below 50cm. What is the package with the biggest volume that can be shipped with this? 

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To maximize the volume of the package while keeping the sum of the shortest and the longest side below 50 cm, we can assume that the package is a rectangular box with dimensions x, y, and z, where x ≤ y ≤ z.

Given that x + z < 50 cm, we can rewrite this as z < 50 - x.

The volume of the box (V) can be calculated as V = x * y * z.

Since we want to maximize the volume, we can assume that x and y are equal (x = y) to create a square base for the box. This will give us the largest possible volume for the given constraint.

Now, the volume equation becomes V = x^2 * z.

We know that z < 50 - x, so we can substitute this into the volume equation:

V = x^2 * (50 - x)

To find the maximum volume, we can take the derivative of V with respect to x and set it to 0:

dV/dx = 2x(50 - x) - x^2 = 0

Solving for x, we get x = 50/3 ≈ 16.67 cm.

Since x = y, the dimensions of the package with the biggest volume are approximately 16.67 cm x 16.67 cm x (50 - 16.67) cm = 16.67 cm x 16.67 cm x 33.33 cm.

The maximum volume of the package is approximately 16.67 cm * 16.67 cm * 33.33 cm ≈ 9,259.26 cubic centimeters.

To find the package with the biggest volume that can be shipped, we need to consider the dimensions that satisfy the shipping condition: the sum of the shortest and longest sides must be below 50 cm.

Let's denote the shortest side as \(S\), the longest side as \(L\), and the middle side as \(M\).

The condition for shipping is:
\[S + L < 50\]

The volume \(V\) of a rectangular package is given by:
\[V = S \times M \times L\]

To maximize the volume, we need to maximize the product \(S \times M \times L\).

Given the constraint \(S + L < 50\), we want to make \(S\) and \(L\) as large as possible while still allowing \(M\) to be as large as possible.

### Maximizing Volume

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

### Dimensions

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

### Final Answer

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$
