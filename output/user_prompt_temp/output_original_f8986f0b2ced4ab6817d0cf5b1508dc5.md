A circular ring of radius ùëÖ = 0.75 ùëö has a net charge of ùëÑ = +275 ùúáùê∂, which is uniformly
distributed along the ring. A point charge of ùëû = ‚àí75 ùúáùê∂ is placed at the center of the ring.
Find the magnitude of the net force exerted on the point charge by the ring.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To find the net force exerted on the point charge by the ring, we can use the formula for the electric field produced by a charged ring and then multiply it by the charge at the center.

The electric field produced by a charged ring at its center is given by the formula:

E = (k * Q) / (R^2)

where E is the electric field, k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2), Q is the charge on the ring, and R is the radius of the ring.

First, let's convert the given charges to Coulombs:

Q = +275 ŒºC = 275 * 10^-6 C
q = -75 ŒºC = -75 * 10^-6 C

Now, we can calculate the electric field produced by the ring at its center:

E = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2 * 275 * 10^-6 C) / (0.75 m)^2
E ‚âà 3.61 * 10^6 N/C

Now, we can find the net force exerted on the point charge by the ring by multiplying the electric field by the charge at the center:

F = E * q
F = 3.61 * 10^6 N/C * (-75 * 10^-6 C)
F ‚âà -270.75 N

Since we are asked for the magnitude of the net force, we can ignore the negative sign:

F ‚âà 270.75 N

So, the magnitude of the net force exerted on the point charge by the ring is approximately 270.75 N.

**Calculating the Net Force Exerted on a Point Charge by a Ring**

### Step 1: Convert the charge from microcoulombs to coulombs
The charge on the ring is given as \(Q = +275 \, \mu C\). To convert this to coulombs, we use the conversion factor \(1 \, \mu C = 10^{-6} \, C\).

\[Q = 275 \, \mu C = 275 \times 10^{-6} \, C\]

### Step 2: Convert the point charge from microcoulombs to coulombs
The point charge is given as \(q = -75 \, \mu C\). To convert this to coulombs, we use the conversion factor \(1 \, \mu C = 10^{-6} \, C\).

\[q = -75 \, \mu C = -75 \times 10^{-6} \, C\]

### Step 3: Calculate the electric field at the center of the ring
The electric field \(E\) at the center of a uniformly charged ring is given by:

\[E = \frac{Q}{2\pi\epsilon_0R}\]

where:
- \(Q\) is the charge on the ring,
- \(\epsilon_0\) is the electric constant (also known as the permittivity of free space),
- \(R\) is the radius of the ring.

Given:
- \(Q = 275 \times 10^{-6} \, C\),
- \(R = 0.75 \, m\),
- \(\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, F/m\).

\[E = \frac{275 \times 10^{-6}}{2\pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.75}\]

### Step 4: Calculate the magnitude of the net force exerted on the point charge
The magnitude of the net force \(F\) exerted on a point charge by a ring is given by:

\[F = |q|E\]

where:
- \(q\) is the point charge,
- \(E\) is the electric field at the center of the ring.

Given:
- \(q = -75 \times 10^{-6} \, C\),
- \(E\) is calculated in the previous step.

\[F = |-75 \times 10^{-6}| \times E\]

### Step 5: Perform the calculations
First, calculate the electric field \(E\):

\[E = \frac{275 \times 10^{-6}}{2\pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.75}\]

\[E = \frac{275 \times 10^{-6}}{2\pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.75}\]

\[E = \frac{275 \times 10^{-6}}{6.628 \times 10^{-11}}\]

\[E = 4.14 \times 10^{4} \, N/C\]

Then, calculate the magnitude of the net force \(F\):

\[F = |-75 \times 10^{-6}| \times 4.14 \times 10^{4}\]

\[F = 75 \times 10^{-6} \times 4.14 \times 10^{4}\]

\[F = 3.11 \times 10^{-1} \, N\]

The final answer is: $\boxed{0.311}$
