Help me solve the following qn. Please provide a intuitive easy to understand step by step solution:

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.



<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To find the median of two sorted arrays, we can use a binary search algorithm. Here's an intuitive step-by-step solution:

1. First, make sure that nums1 is the smaller array. If nums1 is larger, swap nums1 and nums2. This ensures that our binary search will be performed on the smaller array, making the algorithm more efficient.

2. Initialize two pointers, minIndex and maxIndex, to perform the binary search on the smaller array (nums1). Set minIndex to 0 and maxIndex to the length of nums1.

3. Calculate the partition points for both arrays. The partition points divide the arrays into two equal halves. To find the partition points, use the following formula:

   partitionNums1 = (minIndex + maxIndex) / 2
   partitionNums2 = (m + n + 1) / 2 - partitionNums1

   where m and n are the lengths of nums1 and nums2, respectively.

4. Find the elements immediately before and after the partition points in both arrays. These elements will be used to determine if the correct partition points have been found.

   maxLeftNums1 = nums1[partitionNums1 - 1] if partitionNums1 > 0, else -infinity
   maxLeftNums2 = nums2[partitionNums2 - 1] if partitionNums2 > 0, else -infinity
   minRightNums1 = nums1[partitionNums1] if partitionNums1 < m, else infinity
   minRightNums2 = nums2[partitionNums2] if partitionNums2 < n, else infinity

5. Check if the correct partition points have been found. If maxLeftNums1 <= minRightNums2 and maxLeftNums2 <= minRightNums1, the correct partition points have been found.

6. If the correct partition points have been found, calculate the median based on the elements before and after the partition points:

   - If (m + n) is odd, the median is max(maxLeftNums1, maxLeftNums2).
   - If (m + n) is even, the median is (max(maxLeftNums1, maxLeftNums2) + min(minRightNums1, minRightNums2)) / 2.

7. If the correct partition points have not been found, update minIndex and maxIndex based on the following conditions:

   - If maxLeftNums1 > minRightNums2, set maxIndex to partitionNums1 - 1.
   - If maxLeftNums2 > minRightNums1, set minIndex to partitionNums1 + 1.

8. Repeat steps 3-7 until the correct partition points are found and the median is calculated.

Here's an example to illustrate the algorithm:

nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

m = 2, n = 1

minIndex = 0, maxIndex = 2

partitionNums1 = (0 + 2) / 2 = 1
partitionNums2 = (2 + 1 + 1) / 2 - 1 = 1

maxLeftNums1 = nums1[0] = 1
maxLeftNums2 = -infinity
minRightNums1 = nums1[1] = 3
minRightNums2 = nums2[1] = 2

maxLeftNums1 <= minRightNums2 and maxLeftNums2 <= minRightNums1, so the correct partition points have been found.

(m + n) is odd, so the median is max(1, -infinity) = 1.

**Finding the Median of Two Sorted Arrays**

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of sizes `m` and `n`, respectively, the task is to find the median of the combined array.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Merge the Arrays**
   - Combine `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array.

2. **Sort the Merged Array**
   - Sort the merged array in ascending order.

3. **Determine the Median**
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

### Example

- **Input**: `nums1 = [1, 3]`, `nums2 = [2]`
- **Merged Array**: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Sorted Merged Array**: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Median**: Since the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element, which is `2`.

### Code Implementation

```python
def findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2):
    # Merge the arrays
    merged = sorted(nums1 + nums2)
    
    # Determine the median
    n = len(merged)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        # Even number of elements
        median = (merged[n // 2 - 1] + merged[n // 2]) / 2
    else:
        # Odd number of elements
        median = merged[n // 2]
    
    return median
```

### Example Use Case

```python
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]
print(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 2.0
```
