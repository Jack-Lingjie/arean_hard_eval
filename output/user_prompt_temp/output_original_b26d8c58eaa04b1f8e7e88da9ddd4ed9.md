<|User Prompt|>
Hi. I have this URL which I can paste in my Microsoft Edge browser, and it downloads a PDF file for me from my Power BI online report. URL is: https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/rdlreports/1bdef01c-30a3-4150-aff2-b3ec4c9edf86?rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDMonthStartDate=6/1/2023&rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDIncomingcall=Aria%20Park&rdl:format=PDF

Of course, it first asks me to log in to my Power BI account when I first enter the URL, and then it goes directly to the report and downloads the PDF. I wrote a python code to do this for me. The code has managed to download a PDF. However, the PDF produced by the python code  won't open - it gives an error when I try to open it "Adobe acrobat reader could not open 'AriaPark.pdf'...". I am unsure what the issue is. Perhaps, the issue is that Python code doesn't know my Power-BI login details to access the PDF, or maybe it is something else? Can you please help? The Python code I'm using is below:

import requests
import os
# Main Power BI report URL
full_url = "https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/rdlreports/1bdef01c-30a3-4150-aff2-b3ec4c9edf86?rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDMonthStartDate=6/1/2023&rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDIncomingcall=Aria%20Park&rdl:format=PDF"

response = requests.get(full_url)
filename = f"AriaPark.pdf"
with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
    file.write(response.content)

print("Reports have been successfully downloaded.")

It seems like the issue is indeed related to the authentication. You need to authenticate your Python script to access the Power BI report. You can use the Power BI REST API with the `requests` library to achieve this. Here's a modified version of your code that includes the authentication process:

```python
import requests
import os

# Replace these with your own credentials
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'

# Get access token
token_url = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/token'
token_data = {
    'grant_type': 'password',
    'client_id': client_id,
    'client_secret': client_secret,
    'resource': 'https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api',
    'scope': 'openid',
    'username': username,
    'password': password
}
token_r = requests.post(token_url, data=token_data)
token = token_r.json().get('access_token')

# Main Power BI report URL
full_url = "https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/rdlreports/1bdef01c-30a3-4150-aff2-b3ec4c9edf86?rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDMonthStartDate=6/1/2023&rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDIncomingcall=Aria%20Park&rdl:format=PDF"

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'
}

response = requests.get(full_url, headers=headers)
filename = f"AriaPark.pdf"
with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
    file.write(response.content)

print("Reports have been successfully downloaded.")
```

Make sure to replace `your_client_id`, `your_client_secret`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your actual Power BI credentials.

Please note that using the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (ROPC) flow is not recommended for production use, as it requires storing user credentials in the application. It's better to use other OAuth 2.0 flows, such as Authorization Code Grant, for production applications.

The Python code you've written is a good start. However, there are a few potential issues that might be causing the PDF to be corrupted or not openable:

1. **Lack of Authentication**: The Power BI URL you're accessing requires authentication. When you manually enter the URL in your browser, you're prompted to log in to your Power BI account. Your Python script doesn't include any authentication steps.

2. **Session Management**: Even if you authenticate successfully, the session might not be properly managed. This could lead to issues with downloading the PDF.

Here's an updated version of your Python script that includes authentication:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
import os

# Main Power BI report URL
full_url = "https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/rdlreports/1bdef01c-30a3-4150-aff2-b3ec4c9edf86?rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDMonthStartDate=6/1/2023&rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDIncomingcall=Aria%20Park&rdl:format=PDF"

# Power BI login credentials
username = "your_power_bi_username"
password = "your_power_bi_password"

# Set up authentication
auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)

# Send a GET request to Power BI
response = requests.get(full_url, auth=auth)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Extract the filename from the URL
    filename = f"AriaPark.pdf"
    
    # Save the response content to a file
    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(response.content)
    
    print("Reports have been successfully downloaded.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to download report. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

**Important**: Replace `"your_power_bi_username"` and `"your_power_bi_password"` with your actual Power BI login credentials.

**Additional Tips**:

- Ensure that your Power BI report URL is correct. The report ID (`1bdef01c-30a3-4150-aff2-b3ec4c9edf86`) should match the one in your Power BI report.
- If you're using a proxy server, you might need to configure your Python script to use it.
- If you're still experiencing issues, try checking the PDF file's properties to see if it's corrupted.
