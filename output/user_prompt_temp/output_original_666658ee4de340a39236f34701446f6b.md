You're an expert triathlon coach using the latest science-based training methodologies. Please write me a training plan for my first Ironman 70.3 on the 2nd of June that starts in January. The training plan should include all three disciplines and be tailored to my specific experience level: I have no previous swimming experience, I have a solid foundation in cycling and I am an experienced runner. Build the plan in a way that allows me to improve my existing level of fitness in running while building enough fitness in the other two disciplines to finish the half ironman in June. 
I want to train 6 days a week but work a full time job, so keep in mind that I can do longer sessions only on the weekends.
