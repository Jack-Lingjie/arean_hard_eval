Two nonhorizontal, non vertical lines in the $xy$-coordinate plane intersect to form a $45^{\circ}$ angle. One line has slope equal to $6$ times the slope of the other line. What is the greatest possible value of the product of the slopes of the two lines?

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
Let the slopes of the two lines be $m$ and $6m$. The tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ is given by the formula
\[\tan \theta = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 m_2}.\]Since the angle between the lines is $45^\circ$, we have $\tan 45^\circ = 1$. Thus,
\[\frac{m - 6m}{1 + 6m^2} = 1.\]Solving for $m$, we find $m^2 = \frac{5}{11}$. The product of the slopes is $m(6m) = 6m^2 = \boxed{\frac{30}{11}}$.

## Step 1: Recall the relationship between the slopes of two lines that form a specific angle.
The slopes of two lines that form a $45^{\circ}$ angle are related by the equation $m_1 = m_2$ or $m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$.

## Step 2: Define the slopes of the two lines.
Let $m$ be the slope of the first line and $6m$ be the slope of the second line.

## Step 3: Apply the relationship between the slopes of the two lines that form a $45^{\circ}$ angle.
Since the lines form a $45^{\circ}$ angle, we have two possibilities: $m = 6m$ or $m = -\frac{1}{6m}$.

## Step 4: Solve the first equation $m = 6m$.
This equation has a solution of $m = 0$, but since the lines are nonhorizontal and nonvertical, this solution is not valid.

This equation can be rewritten as $m^2 = -\frac{1}{6}$.

## Step 6: Solve for $m$ in the equation $m^2 = -\frac{1}{6}$.
Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, there are no real solutions for $m$.
