the bookkeeper for a plant nursery, a newly formed corporation. The plant nursery had the following transactions for their business:
    Four shareholders contributed $60,000 ($15,000 each) in exchange for the plant nursery's common stock.
    The plant nursery purchases inventory for $10,000. The plant nursery paid cash for the invoice. 

What are the effects on the plant nursery's accounting equation?

The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Let's analyze the transactions and their effects on the accounting equation.

1. Four shareholders contributed $60,000 ($15,000 each) in exchange for the plant nursery's common stock.

This transaction increases the assets (cash) by $60,000 and increases the equity (common stock) by $60,000. The new accounting equation is:

Assets (Cash) = Liabilities + Equity (Common Stock)
$60,000 = $0 + $60,000

2. The plant nursery purchases inventory for $10,000. The plant nursery paid cash for the invoice.

This transaction decreases the assets (cash) by $10,000 and increases another asset (inventory) by $10,000. The accounting equation remains balanced:

Assets (Cash + Inventory) = Liabilities + Equity (Common Stock)
$50,000 (Cash) + $10,000 (Inventory) = $0 + $60,000

So, after both transactions, the plant nursery's accounting equation is:

Assets (Cash + Inventory) = Liabilities + Equity (Common Stock)
$50,000 (Cash) + $10,000 (Inventory) = $0 + $60,000

The plant nursery's accounting equation is:

**Assets** = **Liabilities** + **Shareholders' Equity**

Let's analyze the transactions:

1. **Four shareholders contributed $60,000**:
   - **Assets** increase by $60,000.
   - **Shareholders' Equity** increases by $60,000.

2. **The plant nursery purchases inventory for $10,000**:
   - **Assets** increase by $10,000 (inventory).
   - **Cash** decreases by $10,000.

**Effects on the Accounting Equation:**

- **Assets** increase by $60,000 (from shareholders) and $10,000 (from inventory), totaling $70,000.
- **Shareholders' Equity** increases by $60,000.
- **Liabilities** remain unchanged.

The updated accounting equation is:

**Assets** = $70,000  
**Liabilities** = $0  
**Shareholders' Equity** = $60,000
