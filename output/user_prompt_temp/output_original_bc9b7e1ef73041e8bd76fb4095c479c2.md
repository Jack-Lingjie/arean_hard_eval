<|User Prompt|>
I have an SQL table with the following schema:
```
event_id int
event_at timestamp
```

I would like to know how many events there are every minute since 1 month ago. I am using databricks database and their SQL flavor

To get the count of events every minute for the past month in Databricks SQL, you can use the following query:

```sql
WITH
  -- Generate a series of timestamps for every minute in the past month
  minute_series AS (
    SELECT
      sequence(
        date_trunc('MINUTE', current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH),
        date_trunc('MINUTE', current_timestamp()),
        INTERVAL 1 MINUTE
      ) AS minute
    FROM
      (SELECT 1)
  ),
  -- Flatten the array of timestamps into individual rows
  minutes AS (
    SELECT
      minute
    FROM
      minute_series
    LATERAL VIEW
      explode(minute) t AS minute
  )
SELECT
  m.minute,
  COUNT(e.event_id) AS event_count
FROM
  minutes m
  LEFT JOIN your_table_name e
    ON date_trunc('MINUTE', e.event_at) = m.minute
    AND e.event_at >= current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH
GROUP BY
  m.minute
ORDER BY
  m.minute;
```

Replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table. This query generates a series of timestamps for every minute in the past month, then flattens the array into individual rows. It then performs a LEFT JOIN with your table, aggregating the count of events for each minute.

**Counting Events per Minute**

To count the number of events every minute since one month ago, use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM event_at) AS minute,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM 
  your_table
WHERE 
  event_at >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL 1 MONTH
GROUP BY 
  EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM event_at)
ORDER BY 
  minute;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM event_at)`**: This extracts the minute from the `event_at` timestamp.
- **`COUNT(*)`**: This counts the number of events.
- **`WHERE event_at >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL 1 MONTH`**: This filters events that occurred within the last month.
- **`GROUP BY EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM event_at)`**: This groups the results by minute.
- **`ORDER BY minute`**: This sorts the results by minute.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose you have a table named `events` with the specified schema. Running this query will give you the number of events per minute for the last month.

**Tips:**

- Adjust the time interval as needed.
- Use `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM event_at)` for hourly counts or `EXTRACT(DAY FROM event_at)` for daily counts.
