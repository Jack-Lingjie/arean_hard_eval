4. Set up Tailscale on the devices you want to access your Jellyfin server from:

   a. Install the Tailscale client on your devices and sign in with your Tailscale account.
   
   b. Once connected, your devices will be able to access the Jellyfin server using the Tailscale IP address.

5. Access your Jellyfin server:
