i need to allocate some space on stack for my local variables (in x86-64 nasm assembly)

To allocate space on the stack for your local variables in x86-64 NASM assembly, you can use the `sub` instruction to subtract the required space from the stack pointer (rsp). Here's an example of how to allocate space for two local variables, each 8 bytes in size:

```nasm
section .data

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Allocate space for two local variables (8 bytes each)
    sub rsp, 16

    ; Your code here, using the allocated space
    ; For example, to store a value in the first local variable:
    mov qword [rsp], 42

    ; And to store a value in the second local variable:
    mov qword [rsp+8], 84

    ; Your code here, using the allocated space

    ; Deallocate the space before returning
    add rsp, 16

    ; Exit the program
    mov rax, 60
    xor rdi, rdi
    syscall
```

In this example, we allocate 16 bytes on the stack (8 bytes for each local variable) by subtracting 16 from the stack pointer (rsp). We then store values in the allocated space using the `mov` instruction with the appropriate offsets from the stack pointer. Finally, we deallocate the space by adding 16 back to the stack pointer before exiting the program.

**Allocating Space on the Stack in x86-64 NASM Assembly**

To allocate space on the stack for local variables in x86-64 NASM assembly, you can use the `sub` instruction. This instruction subtracts a value from the stack pointer (`rsp` register), effectively reserving space on the stack.

### Example

```nasm
; Allocate space for a local variable
; Assume we want to reserve space for an integer variable

; Save the current stack pointer value
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp

; Reserve space for the local variable
sub rsp, 8  ; Reserve 8 bytes (size of an integer)

; Use the local variable...
mov eax, 10  ; Example: store the value 10 in the local variable

; Clean up
mov rsp, rbp  ; Restore the original stack pointer
pop rbp       ; Restore the original base pointer
```

### Key Points:

- **`push rbp`**: Saves the current value of the `rbp` register on the stack.
- **`mov rbp, rsp`**: Copies the current stack pointer (`rsp`) to `rbp`, establishing a new stack frame.
- **`sub rsp, 8`**: Allocates space for the local variable by subtracting 8 bytes from the stack pointer (`rsp`). This is equivalent to reserving space for an integer variable.
- **`mov eax, 10`**: An example of using the local variable. In this case, it stores the value 10 in the local variable.
- **`mov rsp, rbp`**: Restores the original stack pointer value.
- **`pop rbp`**: Restores the original base pointer value.

### Best Practices:

- Always establish a new stack frame with `push rbp` and `mov rbp, rsp`.
- Use `sub rsp, <size>` to allocate space for local variables.
- Clean up by restoring the original stack pointer and base pointer values.

### Example Use Case:

```nasm
section .text
global _start

_start:
    ; Allocate space for a local variable
    push rbp
    mov rbp, rsp
    sub rsp, 8  ; Reserve space for an integer variable

    ; Use the local variable
    mov eax, 10  ; Store the value 10 in the local variable

    ; Clean up
    mov rsp, rbp
    pop rbp

    ; Exit the program
    mov rax, 60  ; sys_exit
    xor rdi, rdi  ; Return code 0
    syscall
```

This example demonstrates how to allocate space on the stack for a local variable and use it. It also shows how to clean up after using the local variable.
