Strawberry and Blackberry Melomel Recipe (5 Liters)

Ingredients:
- 2 kg honey (preferably a light variety, like clover or orange blossom)
- 1.5 kg fresh strawberries
- 1.5 kg fresh blackberries
- 4.5 L water
- 1 tsp yeast nutrient
- 1 tsp pectic enzyme
- 1 packet wine yeast (e.g., Lalvin 71B-1122 or Red Star Premier Cuvee)

Instructions:

1. Sanitize all equipment that will come into contact with the melomel, including fermenter, airlock, stirring spoon, and any other tools.

2. Rinse the strawberries and blackberries thoroughly. Remove any stems or leaves, and cut the strawberries into halves or quarters.

3. In a large pot, bring 2.5 L of water to a boil. Once boiling, remove from heat and slowly stir in the honey until it is fully dissolved. This mixture is called "must."

4. Allow the must to cool to room temperature (around 20-25°C). While waiting, add the strawberries and blackberries to the fermenter.

5. Once the must has cooled, pour it into the fermenter over the fruit. Add the remaining 2 L of water to the fermenter, making sure the total volume is 5 L.

6. Add the pectic enzyme and yeast nutrient to the fermenter, and stir gently to combine.

7. Hydrate the wine yeast according to the packet instructions, then add it to the fermenter. Stir gently to mix the yeast into the must.

8. Seal the fermenter with an airlock, and store it in a dark, temperature-stable area (ideally 18-22°C).

9. Allow the melomel to ferment for 2-3 weeks, or until fermentation activity has stopped. You can check this by observing the airlock for a lack of bubbling.

10. Once fermentation is complete, use a sanitized siphon to rack the melomel into a clean, sanitized secondary fermenter, leaving behind the fruit and sediment.

11. Attach the airlock to the secondary fermenter, and let the melomel age for at least 2-3 months. For a smoother, more refined flavor, you can age it for up to a year.

12. After aging, siphon the melomel into sanitized bottles, leaving behind any remaining sediment. Seal the bottles with corks or caps.

13. Allow the bottled melomel to age for an additional 3-6 months before enjoying. The flavor will continue to improve with time.

Note: Always sanitize your equipment to prevent contamination and spoilage.

**Melomel Recipe: Strawberry and Blackberry**

### Ingredients:

- **Fruit:**
  - 2 kg strawberries
  - 1 kg blackberries

- **Yeast:**
  - 1 packet (7g) of wine yeast (e.g., Red Star Premier Cuvee)

- **Water:**
  - 5 L water

- **Sugar:**
  - 1.5 kg granulated sugar

- **Acid Blend:**
  - 1 tsp acid blend (optional, but recommended for balance)

### Equipment:

- Large pot
- Fermentation vessel (food-grade plastic or glass)
- Hydrometer
- Siphon
- Airlock

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Fruit:**
   - Wash the strawberries and blackberries thoroughly.
   - Remove any stems or leaves.
   - Crush the fruit to release its juice.

2. **Create the Must:**
   - Combine the crushed fruit and water in a large pot.
   - Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
   - Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve into a large container.

3. **Add Sugar and Acid Blend:**
   - Add the sugar and acid blend (if using) to the must.
   - Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved.

4. **Cool the Must:**
   - Allow the must to cool to room temperature.

5. **Pitch the Yeast:**
   - Once the must has cooled, add the yeast.
   - Stir gently to distribute the yeast evenly.

6. **Transfer to Fermentation Vessel:**
   - Transfer the must to the fermentation vessel.
   - Fit the vessel with an airlock.

7. **Monitor Fermentation:**
   - Allow the melomel to ferment for 2-3 weeks.
   - Monitor the airlock for bubbles, which indicate fermentation.

8. **Rack the Melomel:**
   - After fermentation has slowed, rack the melomel into a secondary vessel.
   - Discard any sediment.

9. **Secondary Fermentation:**
   - Allow the melomel to undergo secondary fermentation for another 2-3 weeks.

10. **Bottling:**
    - Once the melomel has clarified and stabilized, bottle it.
    - Store the bottles in a cool, dark place.

### Notes:

- **Hydrometer:** Use a hydrometer to monitor the specific gravity of the must before and after fermentation. This will help you determine the alcohol content of the melomel.
- **Fermentation Time:** The fermentation time may vary depending on factors such as temperature and yeast activity.
- **Storage:** Store the melomel in a cool, dark place to prevent oxidation and spoilage.
