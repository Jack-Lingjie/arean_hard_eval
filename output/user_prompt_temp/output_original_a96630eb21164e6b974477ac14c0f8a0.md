Background of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to a system for detecting undercurrent faults in heated grip applications for two-wheeled vehicles, and more specifically, to a system that can detect undercurrent faults without the need for a current sensor.

In conventional heated grip systems for two-wheeled vehicles, a Master Electronic Control Unit (ECU) sends a command to a Slave ECU to initiate the heating of the coil. Upon receiving this command, the Slave ECU generates a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal to heat the coil and begins reading the temperature sensor. The coil, while heating the element, consumes a significant amount of current. Ideally, there should be a direct provision from the hardware to sense the actual current consumption and provide this information to the microcontroller. Based on this information, the microcontroller can decide whether to set an undercurrent fault or not.

However, in the existing hardware setup, there is no provision to sense the current. Adding a current sensing hardware into the existing product would attract additional costs and complexities in further component arrangements of the product. The existing solutions may use a current sensor or a shunt resistor to measure the actual current consumption of the coil and compare it with a threshold value. Based on these parameters, the undercurrent detection can be easily done. However, this solution would require additional hardware components, which would increase the cost and complexity of the system. Moreover, the current sensor or the shunt resistor could introduce noise or interference in the PWM signal, affecting the heating performance of the coil.

Therefore, there is a need for an improved system for detecting undercurrent faults in heated grip applications for two-wheeled vehicles that does not require a current sensor or additional hardware components, and that can effectively detect undercurrent faults without affecting the heating performance of the coil.

Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides a system for detecting undercurrent faults in heated grip applications for two-wheeled vehicles without the need for a current sensor. The system overcomes the limitations of the existing hardware setup by providing a cost-effective and efficient solution for detecting undercurrent faults without introducing noise or interference in the PWM signal or affecting the heating performance of the coil.
