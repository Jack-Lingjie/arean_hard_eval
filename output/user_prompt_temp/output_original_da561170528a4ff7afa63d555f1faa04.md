Write code to simulate a ballistic projectile in non-uniform gravity.

<|The Start of Assistant A's Answer|>
To simulate a ballistic projectile in non-uniform gravity, we can use the numerical integration method, such as the Euler method or the Verlet method. Here, I'll provide a Python code using the Euler method to simulate a projectile in non-uniform gravity.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
g0 = 9.81  # m/s^2, standard gravity at Earth's surface
R_earth = 6371000  # m, Earth's radius
dt = 0.01  # s, time step
v0 = 100  # m/s, initial velocity
angle = 45  # degrees, launch angle
simulation_time = 20  # s, total simulation time

# Functions
def gravity(y):
    return g0 * (R_earth / (R_earth + y))**2

def euler_step(x, y, vx, vy):
    ax = 0
    ay = -gravity(y)
    x_new = x + vx * dt
    y_new = y + vy * dt
    vx_new = vx + ax * dt
    vy_new = vy + ay * dt
    return x_new, y_new, vx_new, vy_new

# Initial conditions
x, y = 0, 0
vx, vy = v0 * np.cos(np.radians(angle)), v0 * np.sin(np.radians(angle))
trajectory = [(x, y)]

# Simulation loop
for _ in range(int(simulation_time / dt)):
    x, y, vx, vy = euler_step(x, y, vx, vy)
    trajectory.append((x, y))
    if y < 0:
        break

# Plotting
trajectory = np.array(trajectory)
plt.plot(trajectory[:, 0], trajectory[:, 1])
plt.xlabel("x (m)")
plt.ylabel("y (m)")
plt.title("Projectile motion in non-uniform gravity")
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This code simulates a projectile launched with an initial velocity of 100 m/s at a 45-degree angle. The simulation runs for 20 seconds or until the projectile hits the ground. The non-uniform gravity is modeled as a function of altitude, considering Earth's radius. The Euler method is used for numerical integration, and the resulting trajectory is plotted using matplotlib.

**Simulating a Ballistic Projectile in Non-Uniform Gravity**

This code simulates the trajectory of a ballistic projectile under the influence of non-uniform gravity. It uses the following assumptions:

- The projectile's initial velocity is horizontal.
- The gravitational acceleration varies with altitude.

### **Code**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
g0 = 9.81  # Standard gravity (m/s^2)
g_max = 10  # Maximum gravitational acceleration (m/s^2)
h_max = 1000  # Maximum altitude (m)

# Initial conditions
v0 = 100  # Initial velocity (m/s)
theta = np.radians(45)  # Launch angle (radians)

# Time of flight
t_flight = 2 * v0 * np.sin(theta) / g0

# Generate time array
t = np.linspace(0, t_flight, 100)

# Calculate gravitational acceleration at each altitude
h = v0 * np.cos(theta) * t
g = g0 + (g_max - g0) * h / h_max

# Calculate velocity components
vx = v0 * np.cos(theta)
vy = v0 * np.sin(theta) - g0 * t - (g_max - g0) / h_max * np.trapz(h, g)

# Calculate position components
x = vx * t
y = vy * t - 0.5 * g * t**2

# Plot the trajectory
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('Horizontal Distance (m)')
plt.ylabel('Altitude (m)')
plt.title('Ballistic Projectile Trajectory')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### **Explanation**

This code simulates the trajectory of a ballistic projectile under non-uniform gravity. It calculates the position and velocity components of the projectile at each time step.

- The initial velocity and launch angle are specified.
- The time of flight is calculated based on the initial velocity and launch angle.
- A time array is generated from 0 to the time of flight.
- The gravitational acceleration at each altitude is calculated using a linear variation.
- The velocity components are calculated using the equations of motion.
- The position components are calculated using the velocity components.
- The trajectory is plotted using matplotlib.

### **Example Use Cases**

- **Simulation of a Rocket Launch**: Modify the code to simulate a rocket launch with a specific initial velocity and launch angle.
- **Analysis of Projectile Motion**: Use the code to analyze the effects of non-uniform gravity on projectile motion.
- **Optimization of Launch Conditions**: Use the code to optimize the launch conditions for a specific mission requirement.
