Given the time-sensitive nature of your exam, I'll provide you with 15 high-yield facts in nuclear cardiology. These points focus on less common information that might be included on the test.

### 1. **Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI)**
- **Definition**: MPI is a diagnostic imaging technique used to assess blood flow to the heart muscle.
- **Key Points**:
  - It involves the use of small amounts of radioactive tracers.
  - These tracers are injected into the bloodstream and accumulate in areas of the heart where blood flow is normal.
  - Areas with reduced blood flow will have less tracer accumulation.

### 2. **SPECT Imaging**
- **Definition**: SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) imaging is a nuclear medicine tomographic imaging technique.
- **Key Points**:
  - It involves the use of small amounts of radioactive tracers.
  - These tracers are injected into the bloodstream and accumulate in areas of the heart where blood flow is normal.
  - Areas with reduced blood flow will have less tracer accumulation.

### 3. **PET Imaging**
- **Definition**: PET (Positron Emission Tomography) imaging is a nuclear medicine tomographic imaging technique.
- **Key Points**:
  - It involves the use of small amounts of radioactive tracers.
  - These tracers are injected into the bloodstream and accumulate in areas of the heart where blood flow is normal.
  - Areas with reduced blood flow will have less tracer accumulation.

### 4. **Cardiac Sympathetic Innervation Imaging (CSNI)**
- **Definition**: CSNI is a diagnostic imaging technique used to assess the function of the heart's sympathetic nervous system.
- **Key Points**:
  - It involves the use of small amounts of radioactive tracers.
  - These tracers are injected into the bloodstream and accumulate in areas of the heart where sympathetic nerve function is normal.
  - Areas with reduced sympathetic nerve function will have less tracer accumulation.

### 5. **Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF)**
- **Definition**: MBF is the rate at which blood flows through the heart muscle.
- **Key Points**:
  - It is an important parameter in assessing cardiac function.
  - MBF can be measured using various imaging techniques.

### 6. **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)**
- **Definition**: CRT is a treatment for heart failure that involves the use of a pacemaker to coordinate the beating of the heart's chambers.
- **Key Points**:
  - It is used to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with heart failure.
  - CRT involves the use of a pacemaker to coordinate the beating of the heart's chambers.

### 7. **Nuclear Cardiology in Heart Failure**
- **Definition**: Nuclear cardiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure.
- **Key Points**:
  - It involves the use of various imaging techniques to assess cardiac function.
  - These techniques can help identify areas of the heart with reduced blood flow.

### 8. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis**
- **Definition**: Cardiac sarcoidosis is a condition in which inflammatory cells accumulate in the heart muscle.
- **Key Points**:
  - It can cause a range of symptoms, including shortness of breath and chest pain.
  - Cardiac sarcoidosis can be diagnosed using various imaging techniques.

### 9. **Cardiac Amyloidosis**
- **Definition**: Cardiac amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins accumulate in the heart muscle.
- **Key Points**:
  - It can cause a range of symptoms, including shortness of breath and chest pain.
  - Cardiac amyloidosis can be diagnosed using various imaging techniques.

### 10. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis vs. Cardiac Amyloidosis**
- **Key Points**:
  - Both conditions can cause similar symptoms.
  - They can be distinguished using various imaging techniques.

### 11. **Nuclear Cardiology in Coronary Artery Disease**
- **Definition**: Nuclear cardiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease.
- **Key Points**:
  - It involves the use of various imaging techniques to assess blood flow to the heart muscle.
  - These techniques can help identify areas of the heart with reduced blood flow.

### 12. **Cardiac Sympathetic Innervation Imaging (CSNI) in Coronary Artery Disease**
- **Definition**: CSNI is a diagnostic imaging technique used to assess the function of the heart's sympathetic nervous system.
- **Key Points**:
  - It involves the use of small amounts of radioactive tracers.
  - These tracers are injected into the bloodstream and accumulate in areas of the heart where sympathetic nerve function is normal.

### 13. **Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF) in Coronary Artery Disease**
- **Definition**: MBF is the rate at which blood flows through the heart muscle.
