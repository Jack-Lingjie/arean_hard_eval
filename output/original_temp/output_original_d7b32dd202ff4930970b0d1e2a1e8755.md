**Econometric Model for Orange Juice (OJ) Price Forecasting**

### Model Overview

This model forecasts the price of orange juice (OJ) based on three independent variables:

- **Carryover**: The amount of OJ inventory from the previous season.
- **Crop Size**: The total production of oranges.
- **Brazilian Imports**: The quantity of OJ imported from Brazil.

### Model Formulation

The model uses a linear regression approach to forecast the OJ price.

#### Equation

\[ \text{OJ Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Carryover} + \beta_2 \times \text{Crop Size} + \beta_3 \times \text{Brazilian Imports} + \epsilon \]

- **\(\beta_0\)**: The intercept or constant term.
- **\(\beta_1\)**, **\(\beta_2\)**, **\(\beta_3\)**: Coefficients representing the change in OJ price for a one-unit change in the independent variables.
- **\(\epsilon\)**: The error term, which captures the variability not explained by the model.

### Data Requirements

- **OJ Price**: Historical prices of orange juice.
- **Carryover**: Historical inventory levels.
- **Crop Size**: Historical orange production levels.
- **Brazilian Imports**: Historical import quantities.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have the following data:

| Year | OJ Price | Carryover | Crop Size | Brazilian Imports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020 | 1.50 | 100 | 500 | 50 |
| 2021 | 1.75 | 120 | 550 | 60 |
| 2022 | 2.00 | 150 | 600 | 70 |

### Implementation

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load data
data = {
    "Year": [2020, 2021, 2022],
    "OJ Price": [1.50, 1.75, 2.00],
    "Carryover": [100, 120, 150],
    "Crop Size": [500, 550, 600],
    "Brazilian Imports": [50, 60, 70],
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Prepare data
X = df[["Carryover", "Crop Size", "Brazilian Imports"]]
y = df["OJ Price"]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")
```

### Conclusion

This model provides a basic framework for forecasting OJ prices based on carryover, crop size, and Brazilian imports. The example use case demonstrates how to load data, prepare it for modeling, split it into training and testing sets, create and train a linear regression model, make predictions, and evaluate the model's performance.
