**Translating SQL to Datalog**

The given SQL query is:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM SUBJECTS
JOIN AUTHORS
ON SUBJECTS.AUTHOR_ID = AUTHORS.ID
BY NAME;
```

Here's the equivalent Datalog query:

```datalog
% Define the predicate for the join
joins(AuthorID, Name) :-
    subjects(AuthorID, _, _),
    authors(Name, AuthorID).

% Define the predicate for the subjects
subjects(AuthorID, Subject, _).

% Define the predicate for the authors
authors(Name, AuthorID).

% Query to retrieve all subjects and authors
?- finds(Subject, AuthorID, Name).
```

**Explanation:**

- **SQL to Datalog Translation**:
  - The SQL `SELECT * FROM SUBJECTS JOIN AUTHORS ON SUBJECTS.AUTHOR_ID = AUTHORS.ID` is equivalent to the Datalog query `joins(AuthorID, Name) :- subjects(AuthorID, _, _), authors(Name, AuthorID).`.
  - The `BY NAME` clause in SQL is not directly applicable in Datalog. Instead, we use the `finds` predicate to specify the query.

- **Datalog Syntax**:
  - Datalog uses a more declarative syntax than SQL.
  - Predicates are defined using the `:-` operator, which indicates the conditions under which the predicate is true.
  - The `?` symbol is used to denote a query.

- **Key Differences**:
  - Datalog does not support `SELECT *` directly. Instead, you must specify the attributes you want to retrieve.
  - Datalog uses a more explicit syntax for joins, which is represented by the `joins` predicate.
  - Datalog queries are specified using the `finds` predicate.
