**Document Retrieval-Based Chatbot with scikit-learn**

To create a document retrieval-based chatbot using scikit-learn, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: **Text Preprocessing**

- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words or tokens.
- **Stopword Removal**: Remove common words like "the," "and," etc.
- **Stemming or Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base form.

### Step 2: **Vectorization**

- **Convert text data into numerical vectors** using techniques like:
  - **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: Represent text as a bag, where each word is a feature.
  - **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: Weight words by their importance.

### Step 3: **Model Selection**

- **Choose a suitable model** for document retrieval:
  - **Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Find the most similar documents.
  - **Vector Space Model (VSM)**: Represent documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space.

### Step 4: **Model Implementation**

Here's an example implementation using scikit-learn:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Sample dataset
documents = [
    "This is a sample document.",
    "Another document for demonstration.",
    "This chatbot uses scikit-learn."
]

# Vectorize the documents
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Create a Nearest Neighbors model
knn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1, metric="cosine")

# Fit the model to the vectors
knn.fit(vectors)

# Define a function to retrieve similar documents
def retrieve_similar_documents(query):
    # Vectorize the query
    query_vector = vectorizer.transform([query])
    
    # Find the most similar document
    distances, indices = knn.kneighbors(query_vector)
    
    # Return the most similar document
    return documents[indices[0][0]]

# Example usage
query = "This chatbot uses scikit-learn."
similar_document = retrieve_similar_documents(query)
print(similar_document)
```

### Step 5: **Integrate with a Chat Interface**

To create a chatbot, integrate this model with a chat interface library like `tkinter` or `flask`. 

**Example Use Case:**

- **User Input**: "What is scikit-learn?"
- **Chatbot Response**: "Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python."

This is a basic example of a document retrieval-based chatbot using scikit-learn. You can improve it by incorporating more advanced techniques like named entity recognition, intent detection, and dialogue management.
