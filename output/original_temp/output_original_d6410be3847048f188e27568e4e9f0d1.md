**Improving the Neural Network**

To reduce the loss, consider the following steps:

### **1. Optimize Batch Sizes**

- **Experiment with Different Batch Sizes**: Try batch sizes between 512 and 2048 to find the optimal balance between computation speed and model convergence.
- **Monitor Memory Usage**: Ensure the batch size does not exceed the available memory (12 GB) to prevent GPU memory issues.

### **2. Adjust Block Sizes**

- **Experiment with Different Block Sizes**: Try block sizes other than 4 to see if it improves model performance.
- **Consider the Sentence Structure**: Since each sentence consists of exactly four tokens, a block size of 4 might be optimal.

### **3. Review Model Architecture**

- **NanoGPT Architecture**: Review the architecture of NanoGPT and consider modifications to improve performance.
- **Experiment with Different Architectures**: Try alternative architectures, such as increasing the number of layers or using different activation functions.

### **4. Hyperparameter Tuning**

- **Learning Rate**: Experiment with different learning rates to find the optimal value.
- **Weight Decay**: Apply weight decay to prevent overfitting.

### **5. Data Preprocessing**

- **Vocabulary Size**: With a vocabulary of 20,000 words, consider:
  - **Subwording**: Use subwording techniques to reduce vocabulary size.
  - **Tokenization**: Optimize tokenization to improve model performance.

### **6. Regularization Techniques**

- **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Gradient Clipping**: Apply gradient clipping to stabilize training.

### **7. Monitoring and Evaluation**

- **Loss Metrics**: Monitor loss metrics, such as perplexity and cross-entropy loss.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use evaluation metrics, such as BLEU score and ROUGE score, to assess model performance.

### **8. Experimentation**

- **Run Multiple Trials**: Run multiple trials with different hyperparameters to find the optimal combination.
- **Use a Grid Search**: Perform a grid search to systematically explore the hyperparameter space.

### **9. Consider Additional Techniques**

- **Data Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Use knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a larger model to the NanoGPT model.

### **10. Review and Refine**

- **Regularly Review Progress**: Regularly review the model's performance and adjust the approach as needed.
- **Refine the Approach**: Continuously refine the approach to achieve better results.
