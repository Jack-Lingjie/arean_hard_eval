You want to ensure perfect forward security by incorporating randomness into the cryptographic process. However, you're concerned about verifying that the session key is indeed generated from the random number and not compromised by a backdoor.

To address this, consider the following mechanisms:

1. **Use a **Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)**:**
   - Compute `hmac(derived_key, random)` instead of `sha(derived_key, random)`.
   - This ensures that any modification to the input will result in a different output, making it detectable.

2. **Employ a **Deterministic Randomness Beacon** (DRB):**
   - Use a DRB to generate the random number. This ensures the randomness is verifiable and comes from a trusted source.

3. **Implement **Provable Secure Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)**:**
   - Use a PRNG that is designed to be secure and verifiable. This can provide a high level of assurance.

4. **Add **Digital Signatures**:**
   - Have the HSM sign the session key with its private key. This allows verification of the session key's origin.

5. **Use **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (ZKP):**
   - Implement a ZKP protocol to prove possession of the derived key without revealing it.

6. **Consider **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)**:**
   - Use SMPC to securely combine the derived key and random number without revealing either.

7. **Regularly **Audit and Test** the System:**
   - Periodically test the system for vulnerabilities and backdoors.

By incorporating one or more of these mechanisms, you can ensure the session key is generated securely and verifiably.
