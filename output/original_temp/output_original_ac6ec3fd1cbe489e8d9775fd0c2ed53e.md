**Combining Pretrained Encoders or Decoders**

To create a new model by combining multiple pretrained encoders or decoders, follow these steps:

### Step 1: **Choose the Pretrained Models**

- **Select relevant models**: Choose models that are relevant to your task. For example, if you're working on a text classification task, you might select a BERT encoder.
- **Consider the architecture**: Ensure the models you choose have compatible architectures. For instance, if you're combining two encoders, they should both output embeddings.

### Step 2: **Prepare the Pretrained Models**

- **Load the models**: Load the selected pretrained models into your project.
- **Freeze the weights**: Freeze the weights of the pretrained models to prevent them from being updated during training.

### Step 3: **Combine the Models**

- **Stack the models**: Stack the models on top of each other to create a new model. For example, you can use a BERT encoder followed by a transformer decoder.
- **Use a suitable interface**: Use a suitable interface to connect the models. For instance, you can use the output of the encoder as the input to the decoder.

### Step 4: **Train the New Model**

- **Define the new model**: Define the new model architecture by combining the pretrained models.
- **Train the new model**: Train the new model using your dataset.

### Example Use Case

**Combining BERT and RoBERTa**

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import torch
from transformers import BertModel, RobertaModel

# Load the pretrained models
bert = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
roberta = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('roberta-base')

# Freeze the weights of the pretrained models
bert.eval()
roberta.eval()

# Define a new model by stacking the pretrained models
class NewModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NewModel, self).__init__()
        self.bert = bert
        self.roberta = roberta

    def forward(self, input_ids):
        outputs = self.bert(input_ids)
        outputs = self.roberta(outputs.last_hidden_state)
        return outputs

# Initialize the new model
new_model = NewModel()

# Train the new model
# ...
```

### Advice

- **Experiment with different combinations**: Experiment with different combinations of pretrained models to find the best architecture for your task.
- **Monitor performance**: Monitor the performance of the new model and adjust the architecture as needed.
