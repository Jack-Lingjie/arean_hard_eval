**Booking a Hotel and Taxi Before a Business Trip**

**Speaker 1:** Hi, I'm planning a business trip to Tokyo. Can you help me book a hotel?

**Speaker 2:** Of course. What type of hotel are you looking for? Do you have a specific area in mind?

**Speaker 1:** I'd like a hotel near the city center. It should be within walking distance to the conference venue.

**Speaker 2:** That's a great choice. I recommend the Grand Hotel Tokyo. It's located in the heart of the city.

**Speaker 1:** Sounds good. How do I book it?

**Speaker 2:** You can book it online through our website. Just click on the "Book Now" button. If you prefer, you can also call us or visit the hotel directly.

**Speaker 1:** I'll book it online. What about transportation from the airport?

**Speaker 2:** We can arrange a taxi for you. If you prefer, you can also take the train. It's a more affordable option.

**Speaker 1:** I'd like to book a taxi. What time should I arrive at the airport?

**Speaker 2:** Your flight arrives at 10 AM. I recommend arriving at the airport by 9 AM to account for any delays.

**Speaker 1:** That's a good idea. What if my flight is delayed?

**Speaker 2:** If your flight is delayed, please let us know as soon as possible. We'll adjust the pickup time accordingly.

**Speaker 1:** Great. I'll make sure to inform you if there are any changes.

**Speaker 2:** That's all set. Your hotel and taxi bookings are confirmed.

**Speaker 1:** Thank you for your help. I'm looking forward to my trip.

**Speaker 2:** You're welcome. Have a safe trip to Tokyo.
