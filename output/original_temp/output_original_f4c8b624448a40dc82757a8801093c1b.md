**Verse 1**
In the murky waters, where the shadows play
Lurks a creature, with a story to say
It's the catfish, with its whiskers so fine
A master of disguise, in this watery shrine

**Chorus**
Oh, catfish, you're a mystery to me
A fish of secrets, in this river's sea
You swim with the currents, and hide from the sun
A phantom of the depths, your legend's just begun

**Verse 2**
You've seen it all, from the river's birth
To the waters that flow, to the fish that give their mirth
You've watched the world change, as the seasons come and go
A silent observer, in this ever-changing show

**Chorus**
Oh, catfish, you're a mystery to me
A fish of secrets, in this river's sea
You swim with the currents, and hide from the sun
A phantom of the depths, your legend's just begun

**Bridge**
Some say you're a monster, with a heart of stone
Others claim you're wise, with a knowledge all your own
But I think you're just a soul, trying to find your way
In this world of wonder, where the sun sets each day

**Verse 3**
You've been around, since the dawn of time
A relic of the past, in this modern rhyme
Your scales are like armor, your eyes are like gold
A treasure of the deep, a story yet untold

**Chorus**
Oh, catfish, you're a mystery to me
A fish of secrets, in this river's sea
You swim with the currents, and hide from the sun
A phantom of the depths, your legend's just begun

**Outro**
In the dark of the night, when the stars shine bright
I'll think of you, catfish, and the secrets you hold tight
A symbol of the unknown, a mystery to share
A catfish's tale, beyond compare.
