**Fixing the Warning: Non-atomic Operation on Volatile Field 'modCount'**

The warning indicates that the `modCount` field is being modified non-atomically. To fix this, you need to ensure that the increment operation on `modCount` is thread-safe.

### Solution

Replace the following lines:

```java
modCount++;
```

with:

```java
modCount = modCount + 1;
```

or, more idiomatically:

```java
++modCount;
```

This change ensures that the increment operation is atomic.

### Explanation

The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that the `modCount` field is accessed by multiple threads. However, simply declaring a field as `volatile` does not guarantee thread-safety.

In this case, the issue arises from the non-atomic increment operation on `modCount`. To fix this, you can use the `++` operator, which is atomic.

### Additional Recommendations

- Consider using `AtomicInteger` instead of a `volatile int` for `modCount`. This provides a more explicit and thread-safe way to manage the counter.

### Example

```java
private AtomicInteger modCount = new AtomicInteger(0);

// ...

modCount.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic increment
```

By following these recommendations, you can ensure that your code is thread-safe and free from warnings related to non-atomic operations on volatile fields.
