**Increasing CPU Utilization for ONNX Runtime Applications**

To boost CPU usage for your Android app using ONNX Runtime, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Optimize Model Loading**

- **Preload Models**: Load models in the background before they're needed. This can be done using a separate thread or by utilizing the app's startup time.

### 2. **Use Multiple Threads**

- **Multithreading**: ONNX Runtime supports multithreading. This can significantly improve performance on multi-core CPUs.

### 3. **Increase Model Parallelism**

- **Model Parallelism**: ONNX Runtime allows you to split models into smaller parts and run them in parallel. This can lead to substantial performance improvements.

### 4. **Use the Latest ONNX Runtime Version**

- **Update ONNX Runtime**: Ensure you're using the latest version of ONNX Runtime. Newer versions often include performance optimizations.

### 5. **Profile and Optimize**

- **Profiling**: Use tools like Android Studio's CPU Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in your app.

### Example Code

Here's an example of how to preload models and use multithreading:

```java
// Preload models
new Thread(() -> {
    // Load models here
}).start();

// Use multithreading
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4); // Adjust the thread pool size

// Submit tasks to the executor
executor.submit(() -> {
    // Run model inference here
});

// Shut down the executor when finished
executor.shutdown();
```

### Additional Tips

- **Monitor CPU Usage**: Regularly check CPU usage to ensure your optimizations are effective.
- **Test on Different Devices**: Performance can vary across devices. Test your app on different hardware configurations.

By implementing these strategies, you can increase CPU utilization for your ONNX Runtime application.
