**TLS SNI and Host Header Mismatch Abuse Example**

### Overview

This example demonstrates how a mismatch between the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) and the Host header can be exploited for smuggling attacks.

### Request Smuggling Example

#### Step 1: Crafting the Request

- **Normal Request**: A normal request with a Host header that matches the SNI.
- **Smuggling Request**: A request with a Host header that does not match the SNI.

```http
# Normal Request
GET /path HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

# Smuggling Request
GET /path HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker.com
```

#### Step 2: Exploiting the Mismatch

When the server receives the smuggling request, it may process the request body before the Host header is parsed. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Example Use Case

#### Vulnerable Server

A server is configured to use the SNI to determine the virtual host. However, it does not properly handle requests with a mismatch between the SNI and the Host header.

#### Exploitation

An attacker sends a smuggling request to the vulnerable server. The server processes the request body before parsing the Host header, allowing the attacker to inject malicious content.

### Mitigation

- **Validate the Host Header**: Ensure the Host header matches the SNI.
- **Use a Secure Configuration**: Configure the server to reject requests with a mismatch between the SNI and Host header.

### Code

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        # Check if the Host header matches the SNI
        if self.headers.get('Host') != self.server.sni:
            self.send_response(400)
            self.end_headers()
            return

        # Process the request
        self.send_response(200)
        self.end_headers()

def run_server(sni):
    server_address = ('', 8000)
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandler)
    httpd.sni = sni
    print(f'Server running on {sni}...')
    httpd.serve_forever()

# Run the server
run_server('example.com')
```

### Advice

- **Regularly Update Servers**: Ensure servers are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- **Monitor Server Logs**: Regularly review server logs for suspicious activity.

### Conclusion

A mismatch between the TLS SNI and Host header can be exploited for smuggling attacks. Always validate the Host header and use a secure configuration to prevent such vulnerabilities.
