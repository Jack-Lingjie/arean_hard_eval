**A-Level Exam Question: Circular Motion**

**Question**

A particle of mass 2 kg is moving in a horizontal circle with a radius of 4 m. The particle completes one full revolution in 10 s.

**Part 1**

1. **Calculate** the **angular velocity** (ω) of the particle.

**Part 2**

2. **Determine** the **centripetal force** (F) acting on the particle.

**Part 3**

3. **Explain** why the centripetal force is necessary for the particle to move in a circular path.

### Part 1

- **Angular Velocity (ω)**: 
  - **Formula**: ω = 2π / T  
  - **Given**: T = 10 s  
  - **Calculation**: ω = 2π / 10 = π / 5 rad/s  
  - **Answer**: π / 5 rad/s

### Part 2

- **Centripetal Force (F)**: 
  - **Formula**: F = (m * v^2) / r  
  - **Given**: m = 2 kg, r = 4 m  
  - **First, find the velocity (v)**: v = ω * r  
  - **Substitute ω = π / 5 rad/s and r = 4 m**: v = (π / 5) * 4  
  - **Calculate v**: v = 4π / 5 m/s  
  - **Now, calculate F**: F = (2 * (4π / 5)^2) / 4  
  - **Simplify**: F = (2 * 16π^2 / 25) / 4  
  - **Further simplify**: F = 4π^2 / 25 N

### Part 3

- **Explanation**: The centripetal force is necessary for the particle to move in a circular path because it acts towards the center of the circle, providing the necessary acceleration to keep the particle moving in a curved path.

**Answer**

- **Part 1**: The angular velocity (ω) of the particle is π / 5 rad/s.
- **Part 2**: The centripetal force (F) acting on the particle is 4π^2 / 25 N.
- **Part 3**: The centripetal force is necessary for the particle to move in a circular path because it acts towards the center of the circle, providing the necessary acceleration to keep the particle moving in a curved path.
