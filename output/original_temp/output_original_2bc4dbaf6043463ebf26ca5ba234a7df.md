**Mocking `func2` in Unit Testing**

When testing `func1`, you want to mock `func2` to isolate its behavior. Since `func2` writes to a `BytesIO` object but doesn't return it, you'll need to use a mocking library to control its behavior.

### Using `unittest.mock`

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from io import BytesIO

def func1():
    """Creates a BytesIO object and passes it to func2."""
    bio = BytesIO()
    func2(bio)
    return bio  # This line is not executed in the original code

def func2(bio):
    """Writes to the BytesIO object."""
    bio.write(b"Hello, World!")

class TestFunc1(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('func2')
    def test_func1(self, mock_func2):
        """Test func1 with a mocked func2."""
        # Create a BytesIO object
        bio = BytesIO()

        # Mock func2 to return None (since it doesn't return anything)
        mock_func2.return_value = None

        # Call func1
        result = func1()

        # Verify that func2 was called with the correct argument
        mock_func2.assert_called_once_with(bio)

        # Verify that the BytesIO object is not empty
        self.assertGreater(len(result.getvalue()), 0)
```

### Explanation

1. **`@patch('func2')`**: This decorator creates a mock object for `func2`.
2. **`mock_func2.return_value = None`**: Since `func2` doesn't return anything, we set its return value to `None`.
3. **`mock_func2.assert_called_once_with(bio)`**: Verify that `func2` was called with the correct argument (`bio`).
4. **`self.assertGreater(len(result.getvalue()), 0)`**: Ensure that the `BytesIO` object is not empty.

### Example Use Case

This mocking approach allows you to test `func1` independently of `func2`. You can modify the mock behavior to suit your testing needs.

**Remember**: Always use mocking libraries to isolate dependencies and make your tests more robust.
