**Syncing Shared Folders Across Network Computers**

To synchronize all types of content between two shared folders on two network computers on a domain, you can use the following PowerShell script. This script utilizes the `Robocopy` utility for file synchronization.

### Prerequisites

- **Domain Environment**: Ensure both computers are part of the same domain.
- **Shared Folders**: Designate two shared folders on each computer. These folders will be used for synchronization.
- **PowerShell**: Ensure PowerShell is enabled on both computers.

### Script

```powershell
# Define the source and destination folders
$srcFolder1 = "\\Computer1\Share1"
$dstFolder1 = "\\Computer2\Share2"

$srcFolder2 = "\\Computer1\Share3"
$dstFolder2 = "\\Computer2\Share4"

# Define the Robocopy options
$robocopyOptions = @{
    Source     = $srcFolder1
    Destination = $dstFolder1
    Options    = @(
        "/MIR"  # Mirror source and destination
        "/COPYALL"  # Copy all file information
        "/R:0"  # No retries
        "/W:0"  # No wait time
    )
}

# Define the second set of folders
$robocopyOptions2 = @{
    Source     = $srcFolder2
    Destination = $dstFolder2
    Options    = @(
        "/MIR"  # Mirror source and destination
        "/COPYALL"  # Copy all file information
        "/R:0"  # No retries
        "/W:0"  # No wait time
    )
}

# Run Robocopy for each set of folders
robocopy @robocopyOptions
robocopy @robocopyOptions2
```

### Explanation

1. **Define Source and Destination Folders**: Specify the paths to the shared folders on both computers.
2. **Define Robocopy Options**: Configure the synchronization options, including mirroring the source and destination folders, copying all file information, and disabling retries and wait times.
3. **Run Robocopy**: Execute the synchronization process for each set of folders.

### Notes

- **Permissions**: Ensure the account running the script has read and write permissions on both the source and destination folders.
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure both computers are connected to the network and can access each other's shared folders.
- **Backup**: Before running the script, consider backing up your data to prevent potential data loss.

### Example Use Cases

- **Initial Sync**: Run the script to synchronize the folders for the first time.
- **Periodic Sync**: Schedule the script to run periodically (e.g., daily) to maintain synchronization.

### Troubleshooting

- **Check Permissions**: Verify that the account running the script has the necessary permissions.
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure both computers are connected to the network.
- **Robocopy Errors**: Review the Robocopy output for any errors or issues.
