**Flowchart for State Machine**

The following flowchart illustrates the state machine logic:

### States

- **IDLE**: 
  - **Description**: Initial state.
  - **Transition**:
    - **To**: `START`  
      - **Trigger**: Start event.

- **START**:
  - **Description**: State when the system starts.
  - **Transition**:
    - **To**: `CHANGE_SPEED`  
      - **Trigger**: Change speed event.
    - **To**: `STOP`  
      - **Trigger**: Stop event.

- **CHANGE_SPEED**:
  - **Description**: State when the system changes speed.
  - **Transition**:
    - **To**: `IDLE`  
      - **Trigger**: Idle event.

- **STOP**:
  - **Description**: State when the system stops.
  - **Transition**:
    - **To**: `IDLE`  
      - **Trigger**: Idle event.

### Example Use Cases

- **Starting the System**:  
  - The system starts in the `IDLE` state.
  - Upon receiving a start event, it transitions to the `START` state.

- **Changing Speed**:  
  - The system is in the `START` state.
  - Upon receiving a change speed event, it transitions to the `CHANGE_SPEED` state.

- **Stopping the System**:  
  - The system is in the `START` state.
  - Upon receiving a stop event, it transitions to the `STOP` state.

- **Returning to Idle**:  
  - The system is in the `CHANGE_SPEED` state.
  - Upon receiving an idle event, it transitions to the `IDLE` state.

  - The system is in the `STOP` state.
  - Upon receiving an idle event, it transitions to the `IDLE` state.
