**Constructive Feedback**

The provided statement discusses autoregressive models and their limitations. It highlights the issue of these models not being able to correct their own errors. To address this problem, the statement proposes generating 100 candidate solutions and then selecting the solution ranked highest by a verifier.

### **Strengths**

- **Addressing a Key Issue**: The statement identifies a significant limitation of autoregressive models and proposes a solution to this problem.
- **Inherent Optionality**: The approach benefits verifiers by providing them with multiple options to evaluate.

### **Weaknesses**

- **Lack of Detail**: The statement does not provide a clear explanation of how the verifier is trained to evaluate the correctness of model-generated solutions.
- **Simplification of Verification**: The statement suggests that verification is often simpler than generation. However, this might not always be the case.

### **Suggestions for Improvement**

- **Provide a Clear Explanation**: Offer a detailed explanation of how the verifier is trained to evaluate the correctness of model-generated solutions.
- **Consider the Complexity of Verification**: Acknowledge that verification might not always be simpler than generation and provide evidence to support this claim.

### **Examples**

- **Training the Verifier**: Explain how the verifier is trained to evaluate the correctness of model-generated solutions. For instance, you could describe a scenario where the verifier is trained on a dataset of correct and incorrect solutions.
- **Complexity of Verification**: Provide examples where verification is more complex than generation. This could involve scenarios where the verification process requires more computational resources or involves more intricate logic.

### **Conclusion**

The statement provides a clear explanation of the limitations of autoregressive models and proposes a solution to address these limitations. However, it lacks detail on how the verifier is trained and simplifies the complexity of verification. By providing a clear explanation of the verifier's training and acknowledging the potential complexity of verification, the statement can be strengthened.
