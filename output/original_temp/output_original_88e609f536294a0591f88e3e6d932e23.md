To plot all the data in the GeoDataFrame, you can remove the clipping operation. The clipping operation was used to restrict the data to South America.

Here's the modified code:

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the shapefile
world = gpd.read_file(get_path("naturalearth.land"))

# Create a new figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the GeoDataFrame on the axis
world.plot(ax=ax, color="red", edgecolor="black")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

In this code:

1. We import the necessary libraries: `geopandas` for working with geospatial data and `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating the plot.
2. We read the shapefile using `gpd.read_file`.
3. We create a new figure and axis using `plt.subplots`.
4. We plot the GeoDataFrame on the axis using `world.plot`. We set the color to red (`color="red"`) and the edge color to black (`edgecolor="black"`).
5. Finally, we display the plot using `plt.show`.

This will display the entire world map with countries colored red.
