To automatically save the current user in the `Features` model when an instance is saved, you can use a few approaches:

### 1. **Using a `save()` Method Override**

You can override the `save()` method in your `Features` model to automatically set the `user` field to the current user.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.utils import timezone

class Features(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    loadeddata = models.TextField()

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.user:
            self.user = self.get_current_user()
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)

    @staticmethod
    def get_current_user():
        return User.objects.get(username=get_user_model().get_username())
```

However, this approach has a potential issue: it assumes the current user is always logged in. If the user is not logged in, `get_user_model().get_username()` will raise an error.

### 2. **Using a `pre_save` Signal**

A more robust approach is to use a `pre_save` signal. This way, you can ensure the current user is set before the instance is saved.

```python
from django.db.models.signals import pre_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(pre_save, sender=Features)
def set_current_user(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    if not instance.user:
        instance.user = get_current_user()

def get_current_user():
    return User.objects.get(username=get_user_model().get_username())
```

This method is safer because it doesn't rely on the `save()` method override.

### 3. **Using a `ModelForm`**

If you're using forms to create or update instances of your model, you can set the `user` field in the form.

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Features

class FeaturesForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Features
        fields = ('loadeddata',)

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['user'].initial = get_current_user()
```

### Example Use Case

To use any of these approaches, you would typically create an instance of the `Features` model and save it.

```python
# Assuming you're using the first approach
features = Features(loadeddata='Some data')
features.save()
```

In the case of the second approach, you wouldn't need to manually set the `user` field.

```python
# Assuming you're using the second approach
features = Features(loadeddata='Some data')
features.save()
```

In the case of the third approach, you would use the form.

```python
# Assuming you're using the third approach
form = FeaturesForm(data={'loadeddata': 'Some data'})
if form.is_valid():
    form.save()
```
