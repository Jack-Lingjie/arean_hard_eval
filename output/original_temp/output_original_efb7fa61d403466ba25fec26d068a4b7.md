**Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) in Stocks**

DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance. This strategy helps reduce the impact of market volatility.

### Measuring Profit/Loss

To accurately measure the profit/loss from DCA:

1.  **Track Initial Investments**: Record the date and amount of each investment.
2.  **Monitor Market Prices**: Keep track of the stock's market price at the time of each investment.
3.  **Calculate Total Value**: Add up the total value of all investments.
4.  **Compare to Initial Investment**: Calculate the profit or loss by comparing the total value to the initial investment.

### Example

Suppose you invest $100 in a stock on:

-   **Date 1**: The stock price is $50. You buy 2 shares.
-   **Date 2**: The stock price is $60. You buy 1.67 shares.
-   **Date 3**: The stock price is $70. You buy 1.43 shares.

### Calculating Profit/Loss

-   **Total Value**: Calculate the total value of all shares.
-   **Profit/Loss**: Compare the total value to the initial investment.

### Tips

-   **Regularly Review**: Periodically review your investments to ensure they align with your financial goals.
-   **Diversify**: Consider diversifying your portfolio to minimize risk.
-   **Consult a Professional**: If you're unsure about managing your investments, consider consulting a financial advisor.
