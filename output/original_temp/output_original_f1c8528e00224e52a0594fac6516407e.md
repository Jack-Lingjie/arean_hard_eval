**Prime Number Search Algorithm in MATLAB**

This algorithm efficiently searches for prime numbers within a specified range.

### **Code**

```matlab
function primes = primeSearch(start, endValue)
    % Initialize an empty array to store prime numbers
    primes = [];

    % Iterate over the range from start to endValue (inclusive)
    for num = start:endValue
        % Assume the number is prime until proven otherwise
        isPrime = true;

        % Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of num
        for i = 2:sqrt(num)
            if mod(num, i) == 0
                % If num is divisible by i, it's not a prime number
                isPrime = false;
                break;
            end
        end

        % If num is prime, add it to the array
        if isPrime
            primes = [primes, num];
        end
    end
end
```

### **Example Usage**

```matlab
% Search for prime numbers between 1 and 100
primes = primeSearch(1, 100);

% Display the prime numbers found
disp(primes);
```

### **Explanation**

1.  **Function Definition**: The `primeSearch` function takes two inputs: `start` and `endValue`, specifying the range to search for prime numbers.
2.  **Initialization**: An empty array `primes` is created to store the prime numbers found.
3.  **Iteration**: The function iterates over the specified range using a `for` loop.
4.  **Prime Check**: For each number `num` in the range, it assumes the number is prime until proven otherwise.
5.  **Divisibility Check**: The function checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of `num` using another `for` loop.
6.  **Prime Number Identification**: If `num` is not divisible by any number in the range, it is considered a prime number and added to the `primes` array.
7.  **Example Usage**: The code demonstrates how to use the `primeSearch` function to find prime numbers between 1 and 100.

### **Tips and Variations**

-   **Optimization**: To improve performance, consider using a more efficient primality test, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test.
-   **Parallelization**: For large ranges, you can parallelize the search using MATLAB's built-in parallel computing tools.
-   **Input Validation**: Always validate user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format and range.
