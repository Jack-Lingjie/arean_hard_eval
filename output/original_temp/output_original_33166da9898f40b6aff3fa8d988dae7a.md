**Determining the Length of Each Workout Plan**

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \(A\) represent the length of each Plan A workout.
- Let \(B\) represent the length of each Plan B workout.

### Step 2: Formulate Equations Based on Client Numbers
- On Monday, 9 clients did Plan A and 7 did Plan B.
- On Tuesday, 3 clients did Plan A and 5 did Plan B.

### Step 3: Formulate Equations Based on Total Training Hours
- Joe trained his Monday clients for a total of 12 hours.
- Joe trained his Tuesday clients for a total of 6 hours.

### Step 4: Solve the System of Equations
- **Equation 1**: \(9A + 7B = 12\)
- **Equation 2**: \(3A + 5B = 6\)

### Step 5: Solve for \(A\) and \(B\)
- Multiply Equation 2 by 3 to align coefficients of \(A\): \(9A + 15B = 18\)
- Subtract Equation 1 from this new equation to solve for \(B\): \(8B = 6\)
- Solve for \(B\): \(B = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}\)

### Step 6: Solve for \(A\)
- Substitute \(B = \frac{3}{4}\) into Equation 1: \(9A + 7\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = 12\)
- Simplify: \(9A + \frac{21}{4} = 12\)
- Solve for \(A\): \(9A = 12 - \frac{21}{4}\)
- Convert 12 to a fraction with a denominator of 4: \(9A = \frac{48}{4} - \frac{21}{4}\)
- Simplify: \(9A = \frac{27}{4}\)
- Solve for \(A\): \(A = \frac{27}{4} \div 9\)
- Simplify: \(A = \frac{27}{4} \times \frac{1}{9}\)
- Simplify further: \(A = \frac{3}{4}\)

### Step 7: Interpret Results
- The length of each Plan A workout is \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour.
- The length of each Plan B workout is also \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour.

### Step 8: Provide Final Answer
- The length of each Plan A workout is \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour.
- The length of each Plan B workout is \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour.
