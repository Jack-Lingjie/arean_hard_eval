**Implementing a Job Monitoring System with Adaptive Email Alerts**

To create a robust job monitoring system, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Data Collection**

- **Store Execution History**: Record each job's execution time, including metadata like:
  - Date and time
  - Day of the week
  - Job type

### 2. **Data Analysis**

- **Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation**: Determine the average execution time and its standard deviation.
- **Identify Trends and Seasonality**: Use techniques like:
  - **Moving Averages**: Smooth out short-term fluctuations.
  - **Seasonal Decomposition**: Separate trends from seasonal patterns.

### 3. **Adaptive Thresholding**

- **High Percentile**: Alert if execution time exceeds a high percentile (e.g., 99th percentile).
- **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjust the threshold based on:
  - **Time of Day**: Different thresholds for working hours and weekends.
  - **Day of Week**: Different thresholds for weekdays and weekends.
  - **Global Trend**: Adjust the threshold to account for upward trends.

### 4. **Handling Sudden Jumps**

- **Anomaly Detection**: Use techniques like:
  - **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**: Monitor for deviations from expected behavior.
  - **Machine Learning**: Train models to detect unusual patterns.

### 5. **Email Alert System**

- **Configure Alert Triggers**: Set up alerts based on the adaptive threshold.
- **Customizable Alert Messages**: Include relevant details like job name, execution time, and threshold.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have a job that processes transactions. The execution time varies based on the day of the week and has an upward trend.

| Date       | Execution Time | Day of Week |
| :--------- | :------------- | :---------- |
| 2023-02-01 | 10 minutes      | Tuesday     |
| 2023-02-02 | 12 minutes      | Wednesday   |
| 2023-02-03 | 15 minutes      | Thursday    |

**Adaptive Thresholding**

- **High Percentile**: 99th percentile = 20 minutes
- **Dynamic Threshold**:
  - **Time of Day**: 15 minutes during working hours, 30 minutes during weekends
  - **Day of Week**: 18 minutes on weekdays, 25 minutes on weekends

**Handling Sudden Jumps**

- **Anomaly Detection**: Use SPC to monitor for deviations from expected behavior.

**Email Alert System**

- **Configure Alert Triggers**: Set up alerts for execution times exceeding the dynamic threshold.
- **Customizable Alert Messages**: Include relevant details like job name, execution time, and threshold.

By implementing these steps, you can create a robust job monitoring system that adapts to changing execution times and sends relevant email alerts.
