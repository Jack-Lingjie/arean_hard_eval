**Acceptance/Rejection Method**

### Overview

The acceptance/rejection method is a technique used to sample from a random variable `X` with probability density function (pdf) `f_X`. This method involves:

- **Step 1**: Generate a random variable `Y` with a pdf `f_Y`. Ensure `Y` is easy to generate.
- **Step 2**: Generate a uniform random variable `u` between 0 and 1.
- **Step 3**: Compare `u` with the ratio `f_X(y) / (c \* f_Y(y))`. If `u` is less than or equal to this ratio, use `y` as the desired realization. Otherwise, return to Step 1.

### Key Considerations

- **Choosing `Y`**: Select `Y` such that it is straightforward to generate from its distribution.
- **Determining `c`**: Minimize `c` to ensure the method is efficient.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we want to sample from a random variable `X` with a given pdf `f_X`. We choose another random variable `Y` with a simple distribution, such as a uniform distribution. We then determine a constant `c` such that the ratio `f_X(y) / (c \* f_Y(y))` is bounded.

### Code Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def acceptance_rejection_method(f_X, f_Y, c, num_samples):
    """
    Generate samples from a distribution using the acceptance/rejection method.

    Parameters:
    f_X (function): The target probability density function.
    f_Y (function): The proposal probability density function.
    c (float): The constant used in the acceptance/rejection method.
    num_samples (int): The number of samples to generate.

    Returns:
    samples (numpy array): The generated samples.
    """
    samples = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        # Generate a random variable Y from the proposal distribution
        y = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
        
        # Generate a uniform random variable u
        u = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
        
        # Check if the sample is accepted
        if u <= f_X(y) / (c * f_Y(y)):
            samples.append(y)
    
    return np.array(samples)

# Example usage
def f_X(x):
    # Define the target probability density function
    return np.exp(-x)

def f_Y(x):
    # Define the proposal probability density function
    return 1

c = 2  # Determine the constant c
num_samples = 1000  # Specify the number of samples

samples = acceptance_rejection_method(f_X, f_Y, c, num_samples)
print(samples)
```

### Explanation

This code implements the acceptance/rejection method for sampling from a target distribution. It defines the target and proposal probability density functions, determines the constant `c`, and generates the specified number of samples.

### Advice

- **Select a suitable proposal distribution**: Choose a distribution for `Y` that is easy to sample from and has a similar shape to the target distribution.
- **Determine the constant `c`**: Minimize `c` to ensure the method is efficient.
- **Monitor the acceptance rate**: Adjust the proposal distribution or `c` if the acceptance rate is too low.
