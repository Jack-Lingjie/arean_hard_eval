**Calculating the Net Force Exerted on a Point Charge by a Ring**

### Step 1: Convert the charge from microcoulombs to coulombs
The charge on the ring is given as \(Q = +275 \, \mu C\). To convert this to coulombs, we use the conversion factor \(1 \, \mu C = 10^{-6} \, C\).

\[Q = 275 \, \mu C = 275 \times 10^{-6} \, C\]

### Step 2: Convert the point charge from microcoulombs to coulombs
The point charge is given as \(q = -75 \, \mu C\). To convert this to coulombs, we use the conversion factor \(1 \, \mu C = 10^{-6} \, C\).

\[q = -75 \, \mu C = -75 \times 10^{-6} \, C\]

### Step 3: Calculate the electric field at the center of the ring
The electric field \(E\) at the center of a uniformly charged ring is given by:

\[E = \frac{Q}{2\pi\epsilon_0R}\]

where:
- \(Q\) is the charge on the ring,
- \(\epsilon_0\) is the electric constant (also known as the permittivity of free space),
- \(R\) is the radius of the ring.

Given:
- \(Q = 275 \times 10^{-6} \, C\),
- \(R = 0.75 \, m\),
- \(\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, F/m\).

\[E = \frac{275 \times 10^{-6}}{2\pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.75}\]

### Step 4: Calculate the magnitude of the net force exerted on the point charge
The magnitude of the net force \(F\) exerted on a point charge by a ring is given by:

\[F = |q|E\]

where:
- \(q\) is the point charge,
- \(E\) is the electric field at the center of the ring.

Given:
- \(q = -75 \times 10^{-6} \, C\),
- \(E\) is calculated in the previous step.

\[F = |-75 \times 10^{-6}| \times E\]

### Step 5: Perform the calculations
First, calculate the electric field \(E\):

\[E = \frac{275 \times 10^{-6}}{2\pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.75}\]

\[E = \frac{275 \times 10^{-6}}{2\pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.75}\]

\[E = \frac{275 \times 10^{-6}}{6.628 \times 10^{-11}}\]

\[E = 4.14 \times 10^{4} \, N/C\]

Then, calculate the magnitude of the net force \(F\):

\[F = |-75 \times 10^{-6}| \times 4.14 \times 10^{4}\]

\[F = 75 \times 10^{-6} \times 4.14 \times 10^{4}\]

\[F = 3.11 \times 10^{-1} \, N\]

The final answer is: $\boxed{0.311}$
