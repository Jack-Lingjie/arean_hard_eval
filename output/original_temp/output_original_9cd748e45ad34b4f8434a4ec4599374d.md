  - **Parses the HTML** to extract the relevant data.
  - **Stores the data** in a structured format.

### Example Code (Beautiful Soup)

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Send a GET request
url = "https://leftwinglock.com/line-combinations/anaheim-ducks/"
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Find the table containing the line combinations
table = soup.find('table')

# Extract the relevant data
data = []
for row in table.find_all('tr'):
    cols = row.find_all('td')
    cols = [col.text.strip() for col in cols]
    data.append([col for col in cols if col])

# Print the extracted data
for row in data:
    print(row)
```

### Step 5: **Run the Script**

- **Execute the script** to scrape the website.
- **Store the extracted data** in a file or database.

### Step 6: **Handle Website Changes**

- **Monitor the website** for changes in structure or content.
- **Update the script** to adapt to these changes.
