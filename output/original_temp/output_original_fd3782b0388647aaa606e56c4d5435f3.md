To assess the effectiveness of bonds as a hedge against equities in the US financial markets from 2000 to 2023, we'll examine their historical performance.

### **Equity Performance (S&P 500)**

- **2000-2023**: The S&P 500 index has shown significant growth, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.5%. This growth is largely driven by the recovery from the dot-com bubble and the subsequent bull run.

### **Bond Performance (10-Year Treasury)**

- **2000-2023**: The 10-year Treasury bond has provided a relatively stable return, with a CAGR of about 2.5%. This stability is due to its long-term nature and the fact that it's backed by the US government.

### **Hedging Effectiveness**

- **2000-2023**: When comparing the performance of bonds to equities, we can see that bonds have not been an effective hedge against equities. This is because the returns on bonds have been lower than those on equities, and the volatility of bond returns has been higher than expected.

### **Key Takeaways**

### **Conclusion**

Their returns have been lower than those of equities, and their volatility has been higher than expected.
