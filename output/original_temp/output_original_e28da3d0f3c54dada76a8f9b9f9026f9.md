**Matrix Multiplication Using Optimized Algorithm**

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra. Here, we'll introduce an optimized algorithm for matrix multiplication.

### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm uses a **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication** approach, which reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2.81).

### Code Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def strassen(A, B):
    """
    Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm.

    Args:
    A (numpy array): First matrix.
    B (numpy array): Second matrix.

    Returns:
    numpy array: Product of A and B.
    """

    # Base case: 1x1 matrix
    if A.shape[0] == 1:
        return A * B

    # Split matrices into quarters
    n = A.shape[0]
    mid = n // 2
    A11, A12, A21, A22 = A[:mid, :mid], A[:mid, mid:], A[mid:, :mid], A[mid:, mid:]
    B11, B12, B21, B22 = B[:mid, :mid], B[:mid, mid:], B[mid:, :mid], B[mid:, mid:]

    # Recursive calls
    M1 = strassen(A11 + A22, B11 + B22)
    M2 = strassen(A21 + A22, B11)
    M3 = strassen(A11, B12 - B22)
    M4 = strassen(A22, B21 - B11)
    M5 = strassen(A11 + A12, B22)
    M6 = strassen(A21 - A11, B11 + B12)
    M7 = strassen(A12 - A22, B21 + B22)

    # Combine results
    C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7
    C12 = M3 + M5
    C21 = M2 + M4
    C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6

    # Construct the final matrix
    C = np.vstack((np.hstack((C11, C12)), np.hstack((C21, C22))))

    return C

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define two 4x4 matrices
    A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

    # Perform matrix multiplication using Strassen's algorithm
    result = strassen(A, B)

    print("Matrix A:")
    print(A)
    print("\nMatrix B:")
    print(B)
    print("\nResult:")
    print(result)
```

### What Can Be Improved?

-   **Handling Non-Square Matrices**: The current implementation assumes square matrices. To handle non-square matrices, you can modify the algorithm to split the matrices into quarters based on their dimensions.

-   **Optimizing Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls can be optimized by using memoization to store intermediate results. This can reduce the number of redundant calculations.

-   **Using a More Efficient Splitting Strategy**: The current implementation splits the matrices into quarters. A more efficient strategy might be to split them into smaller sub-matrices based on their dimensions.

-   **Implementing a Hybrid Approach**: For smaller matrices, the standard matrix multiplication algorithm might be more efficient. A hybrid approach can switch between the Strassen's algorithm and the standard algorithm based on the matrix size.

-   **Parallelizing the Algorithm**: The Strassen's algorithm can be parallelized to take advantage of multi-core processors. This can significantly improve performance for large matrices.

-   **Using a More Efficient Data Structure**: The current implementation uses NumPy arrays. A more efficient data structure, such as a matrix class with optimized operations, can further improve performance.

By addressing these areas, you can optimize the matrix multiplication algorithm for better performance and scalability.
