**Circle Class Inheritance**
================================

Below is an example of a Python class `Circle` that inherits from the `Shape` class.

### Code

```python
# Define the Shape class
class Shape:
    """Base class for shapes."""
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def area(self):
        """Method to calculate the area of the shape."""
        pass

    def perimeter(self):
        """Method to calculate the perimeter of the shape."""
        pass


# Define the Circle class
class Circle(Shape):
    """
    A class used to represent a Circle.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    radius : float
        The radius of the circle.

    Methods:
    -------
    area()
        Calculates the area of the circle.
    perimeter()
        Calculates the perimeter of the circle.
    """

    def __init__(self, radius):
        """
        Initializes a Circle object.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        radius : float
            The radius of the circle.
        """
        super().__init__()
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        """
        Calculates the area of the circle.

        Returns:
        -------
        float
            The area of the circle.
        """
        return 3.14159 * (self.radius ** 2)

    def perimeter(self):
        """
        Calculates the perimeter of the circle.

        Returns:
        -------
        float
            The perimeter of the circle.
        """
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius
```

### Explanation

- **Shape Class**: This is the base class for all shapes. It includes methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a shape.
- **Circle Class**: This class inherits from the `Shape` class. It has an `__init__` method to initialize a circle with a given radius. The `area` and `perimeter` methods are overridden to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle.

### Example Use Case

```python
# Create a Circle object
circle = Circle(5)

# Calculate the area and perimeter of the circle
area = circle.area()
perimeter = circle.perimeter()

# Print the results
print(f"Area: {area}")
print(f"Perimeter: {perimeter}")
```

This example demonstrates how to create a `Circle` object and use its methods to calculate its area and perimeter.
