**SQLite Syntax Error**

The error occurs because of a missing space between the table names in the SQL query.

### Corrected Code

```python
# Fetch authorized users for the given device
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT users.key FROM users "
    "INNER JOIN permissions "
    "ON users.key = permissions.user_key "
    "WHERE permissions.device_id = ?",
    (device_id,)
)

authorized_users = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
```

### Explanation

- The issue arises from the lack of spaces between the table names (`users` and `permissions`) in the SQL query.
- SQLite requires spaces between keywords and identifiers to avoid syntax errors.

### Example Use Case

To use this corrected code:

1. **Fetch Authorized Users**:

    ```python
    device_id = 123  # Replace with the actual device ID
    cursor.execute(
        "SELECT users.key FROM users "
        "INNER JOIN permissions "
        "ON users.key = permissions.user_key "
        "WHERE permissions.device_id = ?",
        (device_id,)
    )
    authorized_users = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
    print(authorized_users)  # Print the list of authorized users
    ```
