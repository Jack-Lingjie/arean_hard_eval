**Calculating Customer Segments**

To obtain the desired results, you can use the following PostgreSQL query:

```sql
-- Create a new table to store the results
CREATE TEMP TABLE dior_seg AS
WITH 
  -- Calculate the total number of female adult customers in the Orchard outlet
  orchard_females AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM Dior 
    WHERE outlet = 'Orchard' 
      AND time BETWEEN '18:00' AND '19:00' 
      AND gender = 'F' 
      AND age_group = 'Adult'
  ),
  
  -- Calculate the average number of male adult customers across 3 time periods in the MBS outlet
  mbs_males AS (
    SELECT AVG(count) 
    FROM (
      SELECT COUNT(*) 
      FROM Dior 
      WHERE outlet = 'MBS' 
        AND (time BETWEEN '10:00' AND '11:00' 
             OR time BETWEEN '13:00' AND '14:00' 
             OR time BETWEEN '17:00' AND '18:00') 
        AND gender = 'M' 
        AND age_group = 'Adult'
    ) AS subquery
  )

-- Select the results into a new table
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT FROM orchard_females) AS total_female_customers,
  (SELECT AVG FROM mbs_males) AS avg_male_customers;

-- Save the results to a CSV file
\copy (SELECT * FROM dior_seg) TO 'dior_seg.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

**Explanation:**

- The query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the total number of female adult customers in the Orchard outlet and the average number of male adult customers across three time periods in the MBS outlet.
- The results are then selected into a new table named `dior_seg`.
- Finally, the results are saved to a CSV file named `dior_seg.csv` using the `\copy` command.

**Example Use Case:**

This query is useful for analyzing customer segments in a retail setting. By calculating the total number of female adult customers in a specific outlet and time period, and the average number of male adult customers across multiple time periods in another outlet, you can gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.
