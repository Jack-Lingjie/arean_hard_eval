**Generating a Random Permutation for a Long Sequence**

To generate a random permutation for a very long sequence, you can use the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and suitable for large sequences.

### Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm

The Fisher-Yates shuffle is a widely used algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence. It works by iterating through the sequence from the last element to the first, swapping each element with a randomly chosen element from the unshuffled part of the sequence.

### Code Implementation

Here is a Python implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm:

```python
import random

def fisher_yates_shuffle(sequence):
    """
    Generates a random permutation of the input sequence.

    Args:
        sequence (list): The input sequence.

    Returns:
        list: A random permutation of the input sequence.
    """
    # Make a copy of the input sequence to avoid modifying it in-place
    sequence_copy = sequence[:]

    # Iterate through the sequence from the last element to the first
    for i in range(len(sequence_copy) - 1, 0, -1):
        # Generate a random index j such that 0 <= j <= i
        j = random.randint(0, i)

        # Swap the elements at indices i and j
        sequence_copy[i], sequence_copy[j] = sequence_copy[j], sequence_copy[i]

    return sequence_copy

# Example usage:
sequence = list(range(1, 100))  # Generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 99
print("Original Sequence:", sequence)

random_permutation = fisher_yates_shuffle(sequence)
print("Random Permutation:", random_permutation)
```

### Explanation

- **`fisher_yates_shuffle` Function**: This function takes a sequence as input and returns a random permutation of the sequence.
- **`sequence_copy`**: A copy of the input sequence is made to avoid modifying the original sequence.
- **`for` Loop**: The loop iterates through the sequence from the last element to the first.
- **`random.randint`**: Generates a random index `j` such that `0 <= j <= i`.
- **`Swap`**: Swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j`.
- **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to use the `fisher_yates_shuffle` function to generate a random permutation of a sequence.

This implementation is efficient and suitable for generating random permutations of very long sequences.
