Shaping a high-hydration whole wheat baguette requires a gentle and precise approach. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a beautifully shaped baguette:

### **Preparation**

1.  **Mix the Dough**: Combine whole wheat flour, water, yeast, salt, and any other desired ingredients in a mixing bowl. Mix the dough until it comes together in a shaggy mass.
2.  **Autolyse**: Let the dough rest for 20-30 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the water. This step is crucial for developing the dough's structure.
3.  **Knead**: Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or knead by hand.

### **Shaping**

1.  **Bulk Fermentation**: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it ferment in a warm, draft-free area for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
2.  **Divide the Dough**: Gently deflate the dough and divide it into two equal pieces. You can use a bench scraper or a sharp knife to divide the dough.
3.  **Shape the Baguette**: Hold one piece of dough vertically and gently stretch it to create a long, thin shape. Use your thumbs to create a slight indentation in the center of the dough, which will help the baguette maintain its shape during baking.
4.  **Fold and Tuck**: Fold the dough in half lengthwise, then fold it in half again. Use your thumbs to tuck the edges under the dough, creating a smooth, even surface.
5.  **Proof**: Place the shaped baguette on a lightly floured surface or a proofing basket lined with parchment paper. Cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it proof in a warm, draft-free area for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

### **Baking**

1.  **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) with a baking stone or baking steel inside. If you don't have a baking stone or steel, you can use a regular oven rack.
2.  **Score the Baguette**: Use a sharp knife or a lame to make 2-3 diagonal cuts on the surface of the baguette. This will help the baguette expand during baking.
3.  **Bake**: Place the baguette on the preheated baking stone or steel and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until it's golden brown.

### **Cooling**

1.  **Cool**: Remove the baguette from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.

By following these steps, you'll be able to shape a beautiful, high-hydration whole wheat baguette.
