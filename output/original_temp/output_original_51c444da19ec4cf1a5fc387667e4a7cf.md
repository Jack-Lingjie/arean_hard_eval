To create a 12-bar chord progression in the key of C that incorporates the Lydian mode, we can use the following chords:

- Bars 1-4: C Major (I)  
- Bars 5-6: E Major (V)  
- Bars 7-8: A Major (bVII)  
- Bars 9-12: G Major (bIII)  

This progression maintains a sense of resolution while incorporating the Lydian mode's distinctive sound. The use of the bVII (A Major) and bIII (G Major) chords adds tension and release, which is characteristic of the Lydian mode.
