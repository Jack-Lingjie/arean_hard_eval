**FastChat Python Implementation**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

FastChat is a simple chatbot that listens on a specified port. It responds to typed questions and follows up with additional information.

**Code**
------

```python
import socket
import json

# Define a dictionary with questions and their corresponding answers
knowledge_base = {
    "what is python": "Python is a high-level programming language.",
    "what is ai": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.",
    "how are you": "I'm functioning properly. How can I assist you?"
}

# Define a dictionary to store follow-up questions and their answers
follow_ups = {
    "python": {
        "what is it used for": "Python is used for web development, data analysis, and more.",
        "is it easy to learn": "Yes, Python is considered an easy language to learn."
    },
    "ai": {
        "what are its applications": "AI has applications in healthcare, finance, and transportation.",
        "is it safe": "AI can be safe if designed and implemented properly."
    }
}

def start_fastchat(port):
    """
    Start the FastChat server.

    Args:
        port (int): The port number to listen on.
    """
    # Create a socket object
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Bind the socket to the specified port
    server_socket.bind(("localhost", port))

    # Listen for incoming connections
    server_socket.listen(5)
    print(f"FastChat server listening on port {port}...")

    while True:
        # Accept incoming connections
        client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Connected to {address}")

        # Receive data from the client
        data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode("utf-8")
        print(f"Received: {data}")

        # Process the client's question
        response = process_question(data)

        # Send the response back to the client
        client_socket.sendall(response.encode("utf-8"))
        client_socket.close()

def process_question(question):

    Args:
        question (str): The client's question.

    Returns:
        str: The response to the client's question.
    """
    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    question = question.strip()

    # Check if the question is in the knowledge base
    if question in knowledge_base:
        return knowledge_base[question]

    # Check if the question has a follow-up
    for key, value in follow_ups.items():
        if question.lower().startswith(key.lower()):
            # Get the follow-up question
            follow_up = question.split(" ")[-1].lower()

            # Check if the follow-up question is in the follow-up dictionary
            if follow_up in value:
                return value[follow_up]

    # If no match is found, return a default response
    return "I didn't understand your question. Please try again."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = 12345  # Replace with your desired port number
    start_fastchat(port)
```

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

1. **Basic Question**: A client types "What is Python?" and receives the response "Python is a high-level programming language."
2. **Follow-up Question**: A client types "What is Python used for?" and receives the response "Python is used for web development, data analysis, and more."
3. **Unknown Question**: A client types "What is the meaning of life?" and receives the response "I didn't understand your question. Please try again."

**Note**: This implementation uses a simple dictionary-based approach for storing knowledge and follow-up questions. You can extend this by using more advanced data structures or machine learning models.
