**Solving the Equation**

The given equation is:
\[5x^2 + 3x^2 = 8\]

Combining like terms:
\[8x^2 = 8\]

Dividing both sides by 8:
\[x^2 = 1\]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[x = \pm 1\]

**Interpretation**

If \(x\) represents the length of a line segment, it can be either positive or negative. However, in the context of length, negative values are not applicable.

Therefore, the length of the line segment is **1** unit.
