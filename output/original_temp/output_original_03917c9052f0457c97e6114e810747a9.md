**Generating SV Constraints for 32-bit Number Transitions**

To ensure that the number of transitions from the previous output is equal to 5 in a 32-bit number, you can use the following SystemVerilog (SV) constraints:

### Using `unique` Constraint

```sv
property p_transitions;
  @(posedge clk) unique {5} $past(output);
endproperty

constraint c_transitions (output);
  p_transitions;
endconstraint
```

### Using `count` Constraint

```sv
property p_transitions;
  @(posedge clk) count(5) $past(output);
endproperty

constraint c_transitions (output);
  p_transitions;
endconstraint
```

### Explanation

- **`unique` Constraint**: This constraint ensures that there are exactly 5 unique values in the sequence of previous outputs.
- **`count` Constraint**: This constraint counts the number of times the previous output value occurs and ensures it is equal to 5.

### Example Use Case

```sv
module example_module (
  input  wire clk,
  output reg [31:0] output
);

  // Initialize output to 0
  initial output = 0;

  // Generate transitions
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    output <= output + 1;
  end

  // Apply constraints
  property p_transitions;
    @(posedge clk) unique {5} $past(output);
  endproperty

  constraint c_transitions (output);
    p_transitions;
  endconstraint

endmodule
```

This example demonstrates how to apply the constraints to a module with a clocked output. The `unique` constraint ensures that there are exactly 5 unique values in the sequence of previous outputs.
