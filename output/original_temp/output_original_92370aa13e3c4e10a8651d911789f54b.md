The plant nursery's accounting equation is:

**Assets** = **Liabilities** + **Shareholders' Equity**

Let's analyze the transactions:

1. **Four shareholders contributed $60,000**:
   - **Assets** increase by $60,000.
   - **Shareholders' Equity** increases by $60,000.

2. **The plant nursery purchases inventory for $10,000**:
   - **Assets** increase by $10,000 (inventory).
   - **Cash** decreases by $10,000.

**Effects on the Accounting Equation:**

- **Assets** increase by $60,000 (from shareholders) and $10,000 (from inventory), totaling $70,000.
- **Shareholders' Equity** increases by $60,000.
- **Liabilities** remain unchanged.

The updated accounting equation is:

**Assets** = $70,000  
**Liabilities** = $0  
**Shareholders' Equity** = $60,000
