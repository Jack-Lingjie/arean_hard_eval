**Forward-Backward Algorithm Implementation in PyTorch**

The Forward-Backward algorithm, also known as the Viterbi algorithm, is used for calculating the most likely state sequence in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Here's a step-by-step implementation in PyTorch:

### Step 1: Define the HMM Parameters

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class HMM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_states, num_obs):
        super(HMM, self).__init__()
        self.num_states = num_states
        self.num_obs = num_obs

        # Transition matrix (A)
        self.transition_matrix = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_states, num_states))

        # Emission matrix (B)
        self.emission_matrix = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_states, num_obs))

        # Initial state distribution (π)
        self.initial_state_dist = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_states))

    def forward(self, observations):
        # Initialize variables
        T = len(observations)  # Number of time steps
        N = self.num_states  # Number of states
        M = self.num_obs  # Number of observations

        # Initialize the trellis
        trellis = torch.zeros(T, N)

        # Initialize the backpointers
        backpointers = torch.zeros(T, N, dtype=torch.long)

        # Initialize the initial state probabilities
        trellis[0] = self.initial_state_dist

        # Forward pass
        for t in range(1, T):
            for j in range(N):
                # Calculate the probability of being in state j at time t
                prob_j = torch.logsumexp(trellis[t-1] + self.transition_matrix[:, j], dim=0) + \
                         torch.log(self.emission_matrix[j, observations[t-1]])

                # Update the trellis and backpointers
                trellis[t, j] = prob_j
                backpointers[t, j] = torch.argmax(trellis[t-1] + self.transition_matrix[:, j])

        # Backward pass
        for t in range(T-2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(N):
                trellis[t, j] += torch.log(self.emission_matrix[j, observations[t+1]]) + \
                                torch.logsumexp(trellis[t+1] + self.transition_matrix[j, :], dim=0)

        # Find the most likely state sequence
        state_sequence = torch.zeros(T, dtype=torch.long)
        state_sequence[-1] = torch.argmax(trellis[-1])
        for t in range(T-2, -1, -1):
            state_sequence[t] = backpointers[t+1, int(state_sequence[t+1])]

        return state_sequence
```

### Explanation

1. **Define the HMM Parameters**:
   - `num_states`: The number of states in the HMM.
   - `num_obs`: The number of possible observations.

2. **Transition Matrix (A)**:
   - `self.transition_matrix`: A matrix where `transition_matrix[i, j]` represents the probability of transitioning from state `i` to state `j`.

3. **Emission Matrix (B)**:
   - `self.emission_matrix`: A matrix where `emission_matrix[i, j]` represents the probability of observing `j` in state `i`.

4. **Initial State Distribution (π)**:
   - `self.initial_state_dist`: A vector representing the initial probability distribution over states.

5. **Forward Pass**:
   - Initialize the trellis and backpointers.
   - Calculate the probability of being in each state at each time step.

6. **Backward Pass**:
   - Calculate the probability of being in each state at each time step.

7. **Find the Most Likely State Sequence**:
   - Use the backpointers to find the most likely state sequence.

### Example Use Case

```python
# Create an instance of the HMM
hmm = HMM(num_states=3, num_obs=2)

# Define the observations
observations = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0])

# Run the forward-backward algorithm
state_sequence = hmm(observations)

print(state_sequence)
```

This code defines an HMM with 3 states and 2 possible observations. It then runs the forward-backward algorithm on a sequence of observations and prints the most likely state sequence.
