When expensing airfare costs with your employer, you need to accurately report the GST/HST portion of the expense.

**Breaking Down the Airfare Invoice:**

- **Base Fare (CAD):** This is the initial cost of the flight.
- **Total V.A.T/G.S.T/H.S.T.:** This is the tax applied to the base fare.
- **Other Taxes:** These are additional taxes beyond the GST/HST.

**Calculating the GST/HST:**

- The total invoice is $312.11 CAD.
- The base fare is $164.99 CAD.
- The total V.A.T/G.S.T/H.S.T. is $15 CAD.
- The other taxes are $132.12 CAD.

**Determining the GST/HST Portion:**

- Subtract the base fare and other taxes from the total invoice to find the total tax amount.
- The total tax amount is $312.11 (total invoice) - $164.99 (base fare) - $132.12 (other taxes) = $15.00.

**Reporting the GST/HST:**

- The GST/HST portion of the expense is $15.00.

**Conclusion:**

- The GST/HST portion of the airfare expense is $15.00.
- This amount should be reported in your company's expense report.
