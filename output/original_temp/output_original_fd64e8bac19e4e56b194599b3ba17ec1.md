**Melomel Recipe: Strawberry and Blackberry**

### Ingredients:

- **Fruit:**
  - 2 kg strawberries
  - 1 kg blackberries

- **Yeast:**
  - 1 packet (7g) of wine yeast (e.g., Red Star Premier Cuvee)

- **Water:**
  - 5 L water

- **Sugar:**
  - 1.5 kg granulated sugar

- **Acid Blend:**
  - 1 tsp acid blend (optional, but recommended for balance)

### Equipment:

- Large pot
- Fermentation vessel (food-grade plastic or glass)
- Hydrometer
- Siphon
- Airlock

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Fruit:**
   - Wash the strawberries and blackberries thoroughly.
   - Remove any stems or leaves.
   - Crush the fruit to release its juice.

2. **Create the Must:**
   - Combine the crushed fruit and water in a large pot.
   - Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
   - Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve into a large container.

3. **Add Sugar and Acid Blend:**
   - Add the sugar and acid blend (if using) to the must.
   - Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved.

4. **Cool the Must:**
   - Allow the must to cool to room temperature.

5. **Pitch the Yeast:**
   - Once the must has cooled, add the yeast.
   - Stir gently to distribute the yeast evenly.

6. **Transfer to Fermentation Vessel:**
   - Transfer the must to the fermentation vessel.
   - Fit the vessel with an airlock.

7. **Monitor Fermentation:**
   - Allow the melomel to ferment for 2-3 weeks.
   - Monitor the airlock for bubbles, which indicate fermentation.

8. **Rack the Melomel:**
   - After fermentation has slowed, rack the melomel into a secondary vessel.
   - Discard any sediment.

9. **Secondary Fermentation:**
   - Allow the melomel to undergo secondary fermentation for another 2-3 weeks.

10. **Bottling:**
    - Once the melomel has clarified and stabilized, bottle it.
    - Store the bottles in a cool, dark place.

### Notes:

- **Hydrometer:** Use a hydrometer to monitor the specific gravity of the must before and after fermentation. This will help you determine the alcohol content of the melomel.
- **Fermentation Time:** The fermentation time may vary depending on factors such as temperature and yeast activity.
- **Storage:** Store the melomel in a cool, dark place to prevent oxidation and spoilage.
