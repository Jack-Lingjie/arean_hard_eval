To process the output of `awk` with `jq`, you can follow these steps:

1. **Use `awk` to Extract the Desired Field**:
   - The `awk` command is used to extract the second field (`$2`) from each line.

   ```bash
   awk '{print $2}' input_file
   ```

   Replace `input_file` with the actual path to your file.

2. **Pipe the Output to `jq`**:
   - The output of `awk` is piped to `jq`, which formats the output into a JSON object.

   ```bash
   awk '{print $2}' input_file | jq -s '. | {result: .[]} | .result | gsub("\\s+", ",") | .'
   ```

   Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the `jq` command:

   - `-s` tells `jq` to process the input as an array.
   - `. | {result: .[]}` creates an object with a single property named `result` that contains the array of values.
   - `.result` selects the `result` property.
   - `gsub("\\s+", ",")` replaces one or more whitespace characters (`\\s+`) with a single comma (`,`).
   - The final dot (`.`) outputs the result.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a file named `data.txt` with the following content:

```text
value1 value2 value3
value4 value5 value6
```

To process this file with `awk` and `jq`, you would run:

```bash
awk '{print $2}' data.txt | jq -s '. | {result: .[]} | .result | gsub("\\s+", ",") | .'
```

This command will output:

```json
{
  "result": "value2,value3",
  "result": "value5,value6"
}
```

However, the desired output is a single JSON object with a list of values. To achieve this, you can modify the `jq` command to:

```bash
awk '{print $2}' data.txt | jq -s '. | {result: .[]} | .result | gsub("\\s+", ",") | . | {result}'
```

This will output:

```json
{
  "result": "value2,value3,value5,value6"
}
```

This is the expected format.
