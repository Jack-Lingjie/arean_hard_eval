To generate the most tokens per second when running a Large Language Model (LLM) on a local PC, you'll want to focus on hardware components that can handle high-performance computing tasks efficiently. Here are the key components to consider:

1. **CPU**:
   - **Recommended**: Choose a CPU with a high number of cores and threads. This is because LLMs are highly parallelizable, making use of multiple cores to process tokens in parallel.
   - **Specifically**: Look for CPUs with a high clock speed (measured in GHz) and a large number of cores. For example, Intel Core i9 or AMD Ryzen Threadripper series.

2. **GPU**:
   - **Recommended**: A dedicated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is crucial for accelerating the computations required by LLMs. This is because LLMs rely heavily on matrix operations, which GPUs are optimized for.
   - **Specifically**: Choose a high-end NVIDIA GPU (e.g., GeForce RTX 3080 or higher) or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT or higher. Ensure the GPU has sufficient memory (at least 8 GB, but 16 GB or more is recommended).

3. **RAM**:
   - **Recommended**: Adequate RAM is essential for running LLMs. The model's size and the amount of data it processes require sufficient memory.
   - **Specifically**: Aim for at least 64 GB of RAM, but 128 GB or more is recommended.

4. **Storage**:
   - **Recommended**: Use a fast storage drive to load the model and data quickly.
   - **Specifically**: Consider using an NVMe SSD (solid-state drive) for the fastest loading times.

5. **Motherboard**:
   - **Recommended**: Ensure the motherboard supports your chosen CPU and has features like high-quality power delivery, USB ports, and SATA ports.
   - **Specifically**: Look for a motherboard with a good reputation for stability and performance.

6. **Power Supply**:
   - **Recommended**: A sufficient power supply is crucial to support the high power consumption of modern CPUs and GPUs.
   - **Specifically**: Choose a power supply with a high wattage rating (at least 850W) to ensure stable operation.

### Example Configuration

- **CPU**: Intel Core i9-13900K
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti
- **RAM**: 128 GB DDR5 RAM
- **Storage**: 1 TB NVMe SSD
- **Motherboard**: High-end motherboard supporting the chosen CPU
- **Power Supply**: 1000W 80+ Gold certified power supply

### Additional Tips

- **Cooling**: Ensure good airflow and consider a high-performance liquid cooling system for the CPU and GPU.
- **Operating System**: Use a 64-bit version of an operating system like Windows 11 or Linux.
- **LLM Software**: Choose a software framework that supports your chosen hardware and is optimized for LLMs.

By following these guidelines, you can build a high-performance PC capable of generating a large number of tokens per second when running an LLM.
