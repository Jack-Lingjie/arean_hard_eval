**Pricing Project: Identifying the Profit Parabola and Predicting Sales**

**Objective:**

1. **Identify the Profit Parabola**: Understand how changes in price affect profit.
2. **Build a Model**: Predict the effect of pricing on sales.

**Step 1: Data Collection**

- **Gather Historical Data**: Collect data on past sales, prices, and other relevant factors.
- **Data Sources**: Include internal databases, market research, and external data providers.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

- **Handle Missing Values**: Use techniques like mean/median imputation or interpolation.
- **Data Normalization**: Scale data to prevent feature dominance.

**Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Visualize Data**: Use plots to understand the relationship between price and sales.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate correlation coefficients and perform hypothesis tests.

**Step 4: Model Development**

- **Linear Regression**: Model the relationship between price and sales.
- **Non-Linear Regression**: Use techniques like polynomial regression to capture the parabolic relationship.

**Step 5: Model Evaluation**

- **Metrics**: Use metrics like R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate model performance.
- **Cross-Validation**: Split data into training and testing sets to prevent overfitting.

**Step 6: Model Deployment**

- **Interpret Results**: Analyze the coefficients and their significance.
- **Price Elasticity**: Calculate the price elasticity of demand to understand how sensitive sales are to price changes.

**Example Code**

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Load historical data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
data['price'] = data['price'].astype(float)
data['sales'] = data['sales'].astype(float)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['price'], data['sales'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a polynomial regression model
model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree=2), LinearRegression())

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train.values.reshape(-1, 1), y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test.values.reshape(-1, 1))

# Evaluate model performance
print('R-squared:', model.score(X_test.values.reshape(-1, 1), y_test))
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
```

**Key Takeaways**

- **Profit Parabola**: The relationship between price and profit is typically parabolic.
- **Price Elasticity**: Understanding how sensitive sales are to price changes is crucial.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like R-squared, MAE, and MSE to evaluate model performance.

**Best Practices**

- **Data Quality**: Ensure data accuracy and completeness.
- **Model Interpretability**: Use techniques like feature importance to understand model decisions.
- **Regular Model Updates**: Update models regularly to reflect changing market conditions.
