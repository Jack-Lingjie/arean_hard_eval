**Calculating the Number of Lands for a Consistent Draw**

To determine the number of lands needed to draw an average of 3 lands in the starting 7-card hand, we'll use the concept of binomial probability.

### **Step 1: Define the Problem**

- **Objective**: Calculate the number of lands required to draw an average of 3 lands in the starting 7-card hand.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The deck contains 99 cards.
  - Lands are evenly distributed throughout the deck.

### **Step 2: Determine the Probability of Drawing Exactly 3 Lands**

- **Formula**: The probability of drawing exactly \(k\) lands from a deck of size \(n\) with \(l\) lands is given by the binomial probability formula:
  \[P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{l}{n}\right)^k \cdot \left(1 - \frac{l}{n}\right)^{n-k}\]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Expected Value**

- **Expected Value**: The expected number of lands drawn in a 7-card hand is the sum of the product of each possible outcome and its probability.
  \[E(X) = \sum_{k=0}^{7} k \cdot P(X = k)\]

### **Step 4: Solve for the Number of Lands**

- **Solving for \(l\)**: We need to find the number of lands \(l\) that results in an expected value of 3 lands in the starting 7-card hand.

### **Step 5: Implement the Solution in Python**

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the function to calculate the expected value
def expected_value(n, l):
    probabilities = []
    for k in range(8):
        prob = np.comb(n, k) * (l / n)**k * ((n - l) / n)**(n - k)
        probabilities.append(prob)
    return sum(k * prob for k, prob in enumerate(probabilities))

# Define the target expected value
target_expected_value = 3

# Define the deck size
n = 99

# Find the number of lands that results in the target expected value
for l in range(n + 1):
    if round(expected_value(n, l), 2) == target_expected_value:
        print(f"The number of lands required is: {l}")
        break
```

### **Step 6: Run the Code**

Running the code will output the number of lands required to draw an average of 3 lands in the starting 7-card hand.

### **Step 7: Interpret the Results**

The output will provide the number of lands needed to achieve the desired draw rate.

### **Step 8: Apply the Results**

Use the calculated number of lands to build your Magic: The Gathering deck.

### **Step 9: Test and Refine**

Test the deck and refine it as needed to achieve optimal performance.

### **Step 10: Enjoy Your Deck**

Enjoy playing with your new Magic: The Gathering deck.
