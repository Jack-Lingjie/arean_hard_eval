**Generating Prime Numbers up to 200**

To get a list of prime numbers from 1 to 200 using a lambda function and list comprehension, you can use the following Python code:

```python
primes = list(filter(lambda x: all(x % i for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1)), range(2, 201)))
```

### Explanation:

- **`range(2, 201)`**: This generates numbers from 2 to 200.
- **`lambda x: all(x % i for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1))`**:
  - This is a lambda function that checks if a number `x` is prime.
  - It iterates over numbers from 2 to the square root of `x` (inclusive) to check for divisibility.
  - If `x` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is considered prime.
- **`filter()`**: This function filters the numbers generated by `range()` based on the condition defined by the lambda function.
- **`list()`**: This converts the filtered iterator into a list.

### Example Use Case:

This code can be used in various applications where you need to identify prime numbers within a specific range. For instance, in cryptography or number theory problems.
