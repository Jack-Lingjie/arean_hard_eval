**Kalman Filter Implementation in GNU Octave**

The Kalman filter is a mathematical method for estimating the state of a system from noisy measurements. Here's a step-by-step implementation in GNU Octave:

### **Kalman Filter Equations**

The Kalman filter consists of two main equations:

1. **Prediction Step**:
   - Predict the state at time `k` (`x_pred`) using the state transition matrix (`F`) and the previous state (`x_prev`).
   - Predict the covariance of the state (`P_pred`) using the state transition matrix (`F`) and the previous covariance (`P_prev`).

2. **Update Step**:
   - Compute the innovation (`innovation`) by subtracting the predicted measurement (`z_pred`) from the actual measurement (`z_k`).
   - Compute the covariance of the innovation (`S`) using the measurement matrix (`H`) and the predicted covariance (`P_pred`).
   - Compute the Kalman gain (`K`) using the covariance of the innovation (`S`) and the predicted covariance (`P_pred`).
   - Update the state (`x_k`) using the predicted state (`x_pred`), the Kalman gain (`K`), and the innovation (`innovation`).
   - Update the covariance (`P_k`) using the predicted covariance (`P_pred`), the Kalman gain (`K`), and the covariance of the innovation (`S`).

### **Implementation**

```octave
function [x, P] = kalman_filter(F, H, Q, R, x_prev, P_prev, z_k)
  % Prediction step
  x_pred = F * x_prev;
  P_pred = F * P_prev * F' + Q;

  % Update step
  z_pred = H * x_pred;
  innovation = z_k - z_pred;
  S = H * P_pred * H' + R;
  K = P_pred * H' / S;
  x = x_pred + K * innovation;
  P = (eye(size(P_pred)) - K * H) * P_pred;
end
```

### **Example Usage**

```octave
% Define system matrices
F = [1 1; 0 1];  % State transition matrix
H = [1 0];       % Measurement matrix
Q = [0.1 0; 0 0.1];  % Process noise covariance
R = 1;            % Measurement noise covariance

% Initial state and covariance
x_prev = [0; 0];
P_prev = [1 0; 0 1];

% Simulate measurements
z_k = [1; 2];

% Run the Kalman filter
[x, P] = kalman_filter(F, H, Q, R, x_prev, P_prev, z_k);

% Display results
disp("Estimated state:");
disp(x);
disp("Estimated covariance:");
disp(P);
```

This implementation provides a basic Kalman filter in GNU Octave. You can modify the system matrices (`F`, `H`, `Q`, `R`) and the initial state and covariance (`x_prev`, `P_prev`) to suit your specific application.
