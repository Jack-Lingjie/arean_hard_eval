You want to manage multiple websites with different domains, but they share the same database and backend. This approach is known as a **multi-tenant** or **multi-domain** setup.

Here are a few ways to achieve this:

### 1. **Subdomains**

- **How it works**: Each subdomain points to the same server, but with a different template.
- **Example**: `blog.example.com` and `forum.example.com` both use the same database but display different templates.

### 2. **Domain Aliases**

- **How it works**: Multiple domains are set up as aliases for a single server.
- **Example**: `example.com` and `example.net` both point to the same server.

### 3. **URL Rewriting**

- **How it works**: The server rewrites URLs to use a common template.
- **Example**: `blog.example.com` is rewritten to use the same template as `example.com`.

### 4. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**

- **How it works**: A CDN serves content from a single location, but with different templates.
- **Example**: A CDN serves content for `example.com` and `example.net` from the same location.

### 5. **Server-Side Includes (SSI)**

- **How it works**: SSI allows you to include different templates based on the domain.
- **Example**: `example.com` uses one template, while `example.net` uses another.

### 6. **Front-end Frameworks**

- **How it works**: Use a front-end framework like React or Angular to create separate templates for each domain.
- **Example**: Create separate templates for `example.com` and `example.net` using a front-end framework.

### 7. **Server-Side Programming**

- **How it works**: Use server-side programming languages like PHP or Python to create separate templates for each domain.
- **Example**: Use PHP to create separate templates for `example.com` and `example.net`.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a website for a company with multiple departments. Each department has its own website, but they all share the same database.

- **Database**: Stores company data.
- **Server**: Serves content for each department's website.
- **Templates**: Each department has its own template.

### Code Example

Here's a simple example using PHP:

```php
// Determine the current domain
$domain = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];

// Load the correct template based on the domain
if ($domain == 'example.com') {
    include 'template1.php';
} elseif ($domain == 'example.net') {
    include 'template2.php';
}
```

This code determines the current domain and loads the corresponding template.

### Conclusion

Managing multiple websites with different domains but sharing the same database is achievable through various methods. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.
