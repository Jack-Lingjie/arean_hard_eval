**Social Graph Database Schema**

To efficiently store social graph links, consider the following database schema:

### **Tables**

#### **Users**

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `integer` | Unique user identifier |
| `username` | `varchar(50)` | User's username |
| `email` | `varchar(100)` | User's email address |

#### **Followers**

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `integer` | Unique follower identifier |
| `user_id` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing the `Users` table |
| `follower_id` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing the `Users` table |

#### **Friends**

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `integer` | Unique friend identifier |
| `user_id` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing the `Users` table |
| `friend_id` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing the `Users` table |

#### **Posts**

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `integer` | Unique post identifier |
| `user_id` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing the `Users` table |
| `content` | `text` | Post content |

#### **Comments**

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `integer` | Unique comment identifier |
| `post_id` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing the `Posts` table |
| `user_id` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing the `Users` table |
| `content` | `text` | Comment content |

### **Relationships**

- A user can have many followers (one-to-many).
- A user can follow many users (many-to-many).
- A user can have many friends (many-to-many).
- A user can post many posts (one-to-many).
- A post can have many comments (one-to-many).

### **Example Use Cases**

- **Get all followers of a user**: `SELECT * FROM Followers WHERE user_id = ?`
- **Get all friends of a user**: `SELECT * FROM Friends WHERE user_id = ?`
- **Get all posts by a user**: `SELECT * FROM Posts WHERE user_id = ?`
- **Get all comments on a post**: `SELECT * FROM Comments WHERE post_id = ?`

### **Database Indexing**

- Create indexes on foreign key columns to improve query performance.
- Create indexes on columns used in WHERE and JOIN clauses.

### **Database Normalization**

- Ensure data consistency by normalizing the database schema.
- Avoid data redundancy by storing data in a single table.

### **Database Schema Evolution**

- Regularly review and update the database schema to accommodate new features and requirements.
- Use version control to track changes to the database schema.

By following this schema, you can efficiently store and manage social graph links.
