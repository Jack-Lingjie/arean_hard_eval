**Transfer Learning Example with Python**

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is used as a starting point for another task. This approach can significantly reduce training time and improve performance.

### Problem Statement

We'll use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats.

### Code

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained VGG16 model
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the base model's layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Define a new model on top of the base model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense
new_model = Flatten()(base_model.output)
new_model = Dense(128, activation='relu')(new_model)
new_model = Dense(2, activation='softmax')(new_model)

# Compile the new model
new_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=new_model)
new_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load the dataset
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255

# One-hot encode the labels
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=2)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=2)

# Train the new model
new_model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

### Explanation

1. **Load the Pre-trained Model**: We load the VGG16 model, which is a pre-trained CNN.
2. **Freeze the Base Model**: We freeze the base model's layers to prevent them from being updated during training.
3. **Define a New Model**: We define a new model on top of the base model using the `Flatten` and `Dense` layers.
4. **Compile the New Model**: We compile the new model with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
5. **Load the Dataset**: We load the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of images of dogs and cats.
6. **Preprocess the Data**: We preprocess the data by normalizing the pixel values and one-hot encoding the labels.
7. **Train the New Model**: We train the new model using the preprocessed data.

### Advice

- **Use Transfer Learning**: Transfer learning can significantly reduce training time and improve performance.
- **Freeze the Base Model**: Freezing the base model's layers prevents them from being updated during training.
- **Compile the New Model**: Compile the new model with a suitable optimizer and loss function.

### Example Use Cases

- **Image Classification**: Use transfer learning to classify images of different objects.
- **Object Detection**: Use transfer learning to detect objects in images.
- **Segmentation**: Use transfer learning to segment objects in images.
