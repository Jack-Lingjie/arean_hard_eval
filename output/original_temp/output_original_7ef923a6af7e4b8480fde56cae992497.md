**a. Value of the Annuity 6 Years from Now**

To calculate the value of the annuity 6 years from now, we need to consider the following:

- **Time Period**: The annuity starts 12 years from now and will last for 20 years.  
- **First Payment**: The first payment occurs 12.5 years from now.
- **Discount Rate**: The discount rate is 13 percent compounded monthly.

Given these conditions, we can calculate the value of the annuity 6 years from now.

### Step 1: Calculate the Number of Payments

The annuity will have 20 payments, each of $7,000, starting 12.5 years from now.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Periods

Since the discount rate is compounded monthly, we need to calculate the total number of periods.

- **Total Payments**: 20 payments
- **First Payment Period**: 12.5 years
- **Compounding Period**: Monthly

### Step 3: Calculate the Present Value

To calculate the present value of the annuity, we use the formula:

\[ PV = \frac{PMT}{r} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n} \right) \]

where:
- **PV** = Present Value
- **PMT** = Payment Amount
- **r** = Monthly Interest Rate
- **n** = Number of Payments

### Step 4: Calculate the Monthly Interest Rate

The annual interest rate is 13 percent. To convert it to a monthly rate, we divide by 12.

- **Annual Interest Rate**: 13%
- **Monthly Interest Rate**: 13% / 12

### Step 5: Calculate the Present Value

Using the formula from Step 3, we can calculate the present value.

### Step 6: Calculate the Value of the Annuity 6 Years from Now

To find the value of the annuity 6 years from now, we need to calculate the present value of the annuity and then discount it by 6 years.

### Step 7: Calculate the Discounted Value

Using the formula for present value, we can calculate the discounted value.

### Step 8: Calculate the Final Answer

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
