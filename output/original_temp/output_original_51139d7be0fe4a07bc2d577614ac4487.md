**Best Practice Frameworks for Organizing Personal Knowledge**

1.  **Getting Things Done (GTD)**: Developed by David Allen, GTD emphasizes breaking down tasks into smaller, actionable steps. It involves capturing all tasks, projects, and ideas in a centralized system.
2.  **The Pomodoro Technique**: This technique involves working in focused, 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This helps maintain productivity and avoid burnout.
3.  **The Eisenhower Matrix**: This decision-making tool helps prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. It categorizes tasks into four quadrants:
    *   **Urgent and Important**: Tasks that require immediate attention.
    *   **Not Urgent but Important**: Tasks that are crucial but can be done at any time.
    *   **Urgent but Not Important**: Tasks that require immediate attention but are not crucial.
    *   **Not Urgent and Not Important**: Tasks that are neither urgent nor important.
