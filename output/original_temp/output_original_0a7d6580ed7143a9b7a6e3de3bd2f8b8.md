**Calculating the Total Cost**

- The cost of 3 pears at 25 cents each is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) cents.
- The cost of 1 lemon is 10 cents.

**Total Cost**

The total cost is \(75 + 10 = 85\) cents.

**Change Calculation**

Given a payment of $1 (100 cents), the change due is \(100 - 85 = 15\) cents.

**Coin Combinations**

To get an odd number of coins, consider the following combinations:
- 1 coin of 10 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents.
- 3 coins of 5 cents.

Both combinations result in an odd number of coins.
