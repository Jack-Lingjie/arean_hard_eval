**Uniformly Sampling a Point Inside a Right-Angle Triangle**

To efficiently sample a point uniformly inside a right-angle triangle, you can use the following approach:

### **Method**

1.  **Generate Random Numbers**: Generate two random numbers, `x` and `y`, between 0 and 1.
2.  **Calculate the Acceptance Probability**: Calculate the probability of accepting the point `(x, y)` based on the triangle's area.

    ```python
    # Import necessary modules
    import numpy as np

    # Define the triangle's vertices
    vertices = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]])

    # Function to calculate the acceptance probability
    def acceptance_probability(x, y):
        # Calculate the area of the triangle
        area = 0.5

        # Calculate the probability of acceptance
        probability = area / (x + y)

        return probability
    ```

3.  **Accept or Reject the Point**: Accept the point `(x, y)` with a probability calculated in the previous step.

    ```python
    # Function to sample a point uniformly inside the triangle
    def sample_point():
        # Generate random numbers
        x = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
        y = np.random.uniform(0, 1)

        # Calculate the acceptance probability
        probability = acceptance_probability(x, y)

        # Accept or reject the point
        if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < probability:
            return x, y
        else:
            return sample_point()

    # Example usage
    point = sample_point()
    print(point)
    ```

### **Explanation**

This approach ensures that the sampled points are uniformly distributed inside the triangle.

-   **Random Number Generation**: Generate two random numbers, `x` and `y`, between 0 and 1.
-   **Acceptance Probability Calculation**: Calculate the probability of accepting the point `(x, y)` based on the triangle's area.
-   **Accept or Reject the Point**: Accept the point `(x, y)` with a probability calculated in the previous step.

### **Example Use Case**

To sample a point uniformly inside a right-angle triangle, use the `sample_point` function.

```python
# Example usage
point = sample_point()
print(point)
```

This will output a point uniformly sampled inside the triangle.

### **Advice**

-   **Use a Loop**: If the acceptance probability is low, use a loop to repeatedly sample points until one is accepted.
-   **Optimize for Performance**: For large triangles or high-performance requirements, consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.
