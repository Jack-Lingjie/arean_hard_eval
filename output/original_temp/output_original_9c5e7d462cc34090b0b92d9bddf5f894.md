To find the package with the biggest volume that can be shipped, we need to consider the dimensions that satisfy the shipping condition: the sum of the shortest and longest sides must be below 50 cm.

Let's denote the shortest side as \(S\), the longest side as \(L\), and the middle side as \(M\).

The condition for shipping is:
\[S + L < 50\]

The volume \(V\) of a rectangular package is given by:
\[V = S \times M \times L\]

To maximize the volume, we need to maximize the product \(S \times M \times L\).

Given the constraint \(S + L < 50\), we want to make \(S\) and \(L\) as large as possible while still allowing \(M\) to be as large as possible.

### Maximizing Volume

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

### Dimensions

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

### Calculating Dimensions

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

### Example Dimensions

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

### Conclusion

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

### Final Answer

- **Step 1**: Choose \(S\) and \(L\) such that their sum is just below 50 cm. This will allow \(M\) to be as large as possible.

- **Step 2**: Since we want to maximize the volume, we should make \(M\) as large as possible.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$
