### Step 2: **Configure Tailscale**

1. **Start Tailscale**:
   - On Linux: `sudo tailscale up`
   - On macOS: `tailscale up`
   - On Windows: Run the Tailscale application.

2. **Join the Network**:
   - Use the access token to join the network:
     ```bash
     sudo tailscale up --access-token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
     ```

### Step 3: **Expose the Jellyfin Server**

1. **Determine Your Tailscale IP**:
   - Run `tailscale ip addr` to find your Tailscale IP address.

2. **Configure Jellyfin**:
   - Update the Jellyfin server configuration to use the Tailscale IP address.

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of how to configure Jellyfin to use the Tailscale IP address:

```yml
# Example Jellyfin configuration
http:
  - "0.0.0.0:8096"

# Tailscale IP address
tunnel:
  - "YOUR_TAILSCALE_IP:8096"
```

### Step 4: **Secure Your Tailscale Network**

- Ensure that your Tailscale network is secure by:
  - Using strong passwords.
  - Enabling two-factor authentication.
  - Limiting access to your network.

### Step 5: **Monitor Your Tailscale Network**

- Regularly monitor your Tailscale network for security threats.

### Example Use Case
