**Loading the Global Offset Table (GOT) and Calling a Function**

To load the Global Offset Table (GOT) and call a function stored within it, you can use the following PPC64 assembly code:

### Loading the GOT

```assembly
# Load the GOT address into register r3
    li     r3, GOT_ADDR  # Load GOT address into r3

# Load the function address from the GOT into register r4
    lwz    r4, 0(r3)     # Load function address from GOT into r4
```

### Calling the Function

```assembly
# Call the function stored in the GOT
    blr    r4             # Branch to the function address
```

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a function `my_function` stored in the GOT at address `GOT_ADDR`. 

```assembly
# Define the GOT address
GOT_ADDR = 0x10000000

# Define the function address in the GOT
my_function_addr = GOT_ADDR

# Load the GOT address into register r3
li     r3, GOT_ADDR

# Load the function address from the GOT into register r4
lwz    r4, 0(r3)

# Call the function stored in the GOT
blr    r4
```

### Notes

- **`li`**: Loads an immediate value into a register.
- **`lwz`**: Loads a word (32 bits) from memory into a register.
- **`blr`**: Branch to a label (used for function calls).
- **`GOT_ADDR`**: The address of the Global Offset Table.
- **`my_function_addr`**: The address of the function `my_function` in the GOT.

This code snippet demonstrates how to load the GOT and call a function stored within it. The GOT is a critical component in dynamic linking, allowing functions to be resolved at runtime.
