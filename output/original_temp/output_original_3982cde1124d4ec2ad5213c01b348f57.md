**Generating a Bass Line in Python**

To create a bass line based on a key signature, chord progression, and number of bars, we'll use the following steps:

1. **Define the Key Signature**: Determine the key and its corresponding notes.
2. **Create a Chord Progression**: Define the chord progression for the song.
3. **Generate the Bass Line**: Use the key and chord progression to generate a bass line.

**Code**

```python
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Define the Key Signature
class Key:
    def __init__(self, key_name):
        self.key_name = key_name
        self.notes = self.get_notes(key_name)

    def get_notes(self, key_name):
        # Dictionary mapping key names to their corresponding notes
        key_notes = {
            "C Major": ["C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "A", "B"],
            "G Major": ["G", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F#"],
            # Add more key signatures as needed
        }
        return key_notes[key_name]

# Step 2: Create a Chord Progression
class ChordProgression:
    def __init__(self, progression):
        self.progression = progression

# Step 3: Generate the Bass Line
class BassLineGenerator:
    def __init__(self, key, progression, num_bars):
        self.key = key
        self.progression = progression
        self.num_bars = num_bars

    def generate_bass_line(self):
        # Initialize the bass line with the tonic note
        bass_line = [self.key.notes[0]]

        # Generate the bass line for each bar
        for i in range(self.num_bars):
            # Get the current chord
            chord = self.progression.progression[i % len(self.progression.progression)]

            # Determine the bass note for the current chord
            if chord == "C Major":
                bass_note = "E"
            elif chord == "G Major":
                bass_note = "F"

            # Add the bass note to the bass line
            bass_line.append(bass_note)

        return bass_line

# Example usage
key = Key("C Major")
progression = ChordProgression(["C Major", "G Major", "Am"])
generator = BassLineGenerator(key, progression, 4)

bass_line = generator.generate_bass_line()
print(bass_line)
```

**Explanation**

1. **Key Signature**: We define a `Key` class to represent the key signature. It includes a method `get_notes` to retrieve the notes corresponding to the key.
2. **Chord Progression**: We create a `ChordProgression` class to represent the chord progression.
3. **Bass Line Generation**: The `BassLineGenerator` class generates the bass line based on the key, chord progression, and number of bars.

**Example Use Case**

In the example usage section, we:

* Create a `Key` object for the "C Major" key.
* Define a `ChordProgression` object with a progression of "C Major" and "G Major".
* Create a `BassLineGenerator` object with the key, chord progression, and 4 bars.
* Generate the bass line using the `generate_bass_line` method.

This code provides a basic structure for generating a bass line based on a key signature, chord progression, and number of bars. You can extend this code to accommodate more complex chord progressions and bass line patterns.
