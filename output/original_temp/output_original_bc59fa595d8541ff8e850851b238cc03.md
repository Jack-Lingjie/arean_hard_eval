To make $1 using 19 coins, you can combine different denominations. Here's one way to achieve this:

- **10 Nickels (5 cents each):** 10 nickels will give you $0.50.
- **9 Pennies (1 cent each):** 9 pennies will add $0.09.

Adding these together gives you a total of $0.50 + $0.09 = $0.59. This combination does not reach $1.

Let's try another combination:

- **10 Dimes (10 cents each):** 10 dimes will give you $1.00.

This combination directly adds up to $1.00 using 10 dimes. 

Therefore, to make $1 using 19 coins, you can use 10 dimes.
