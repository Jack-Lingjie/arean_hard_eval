Solving a Rubik's Cube can be a fun and rewarding challenge. Here's a step-by-step guide to help a young person learn how to solve it:

**Step 1: Understand the Notation**

Before we dive into the solution, it's essential to understand the notation used:

- **F** (Front): The side facing you.
- **B** (Back): The side opposite the front.
- **U** (Up): The top side.
- **D** (Down): The bottom side.
- **L** (Left): The left side.
- **R** (Right): The right side.

**Step 2: Learn the Fundamental Moves**

To solve the cube, you'll need to learn a few fundamental moves. These moves are the building blocks of more complex algorithms.

- **U-turn**: Rotate the top layer (U) clockwise.
- **D-turn**: Rotate the bottom layer (D) clockwise.
- **L-turn**: Rotate the left middle layer (L) clockwise.
- **R-turn**: Rotate the right middle layer (R) clockwise.
- **F-turn**: Rotate the front middle layer (F) clockwise.
- **B-turn**: Rotate the back middle layer (B) clockwise.

**Step 3: Solve the White Cross**

1. **Hold the Cube**: Hold the cube in front of you with the white cross facing upwards.
2. **Find a White Edge**: Look for a white edge piece on the top layer.
3. **Solve the White Edge**:
   - If the white edge is on the front (F) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the white edge is on the top layer.
     - Perform a **U-turn**.
     - If the white edge is not in its correct position, perform a **U-turn** again.
   - If the white edge is on the left (L) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the white edge is on the top layer.
     - Perform a **U-turn**.
     - If the white edge is not in its correct position, perform a **U-turn** again.

**Step 4: Solve the White Corners**

1. **Hold the Cube**: Hold the cube in front of you with the white cross facing upwards.
2. **Find a White Corner**: Look for a white corner piece on the top layer.
3. **Solve the White Corner**:
   - If the white corner is on the front (F) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the white corner is on the top layer.
     - Perform a **U-turn**.
     - If the white corner is not in its correct position, perform a **U-turn** again.
   - If the white corner is on the left (L) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the white corner is on the top layer.
     - Perform a **U-turn**.
     - If the white corner is not in its correct position, perform a **U-turn** again.

**Step 5: Solve the Middle Layer**

1. **Hold the Cube**: Hold the cube in front of you with the white cross facing upwards.
2. **Find a Middle Layer Edge**: Look for a middle layer edge piece.
3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edge**:
   - If the middle layer edge is on the front (F) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the middle layer edge is on the middle layer.
     - Perform a **F-turn**.
     - If the middle layer edge is not in its correct position, perform a **F-turn** again.
   - If the middle layer edge is on the left (L) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the middle layer edge is on the middle layer.
     - Perform a **L-turn**.
     - If the middle layer edge is not in its correct position, perform a **L-turn** again.

**Step 6: Solve the Yellow Cross**

1. **Hold the Cube**: Hold the cube in front of you with the white cross facing upwards.
2. **Find a Yellow Edge**: Look for a yellow edge piece on the middle layer.
3. **Solve the Yellow Edge**:
   - If the yellow edge is on the front (F) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the yellow edge is on the middle layer.
     - Perform a **F-turn**.
     - If the yellow edge is not in its correct position, perform a **F-turn** again.
   - If the yellow edge is on the left (L) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the yellow edge is on the middle layer.
     - Perform a **L-turn**.
     - If the yellow edge is not in its correct position, perform a **L-turn** again.

**Step 7: Solve the Yellow Corners**

1. **Hold the Cube**: Hold the cube in front of you with the white cross facing upwards.
2. **Find a Yellow Corner**: Look for a yellow corner piece on the middle layer.
3. **Solve the Yellow Corner**:
   - If the yellow corner is on the front (F) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the yellow corner is on the middle layer.
     - Perform a **F-turn**.
     - If the yellow corner is not in its correct position, perform a **F-turn** again.
   - If the yellow corner is on the left (L) side, perform the following steps:
     - Hold the cube so that the yellow corner is on the middle layer.
     - Perform a **L-turn**.
     - If the yellow corner is not in its correct position, perform a **L-turn** again.

**Step 8: Finalize the Cube**

1. **Hold the Cube**: Hold the cube in front of you with the white cross facing upwards.
2. **Check the Cube**: Check if the cube is solved.
