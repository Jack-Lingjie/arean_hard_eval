**Understanding the Error**

The error `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException: Task was cancelled` indicates that a task was interrupted or cancelled while it was being executed.

**Stacktrace Breakdown**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the stacktrace:

1. **`X.0i9.A02(Unknown Source:32)`**: This line suggests that the error occurred in the `A02` method of the `X.0i9` class.
2. **`at X.0i9.get(Unknown Source:47)`**: The error propagated to the `get` method of the `X.0i9` class.
3. **`at X.0lz.run(Unknown Source:4)`**: The task was executed by the `X.0lz` class.
4. **`at X.0m4.run(Unknown Source:2)`**: The task was submitted to a thread pool executor, which is managed by the `X.0m4` class.
5. **`at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)`**: The thread pool executor is part of the Java standard library.
6. **`at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:644)`**: The worker thread is executing the task.
7. **`at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1012)`**: The thread is running the task.

**Solving the Error**

To resolve this issue:

### **1. Check for Interrupted Tasks**

Ensure that tasks are properly checked for interruption using `Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()`.

### **2. Handle Cancellation**

Implement a mechanism to handle task cancellation, such as:

```java
try {
    // Task execution code
} catch (CancellationException e) {
    // Handle task cancellation
}
```

### **3. Review Thread Pool Configuration**

Verify that the thread pool is properly configured to handle task cancellation.

### **4. Use `Future.cancel()`**

If using `Future` objects, ensure that `cancel()` is called when a task needs to be cancelled.

### **5. Debug the Code**

Use a debugger to step through the code and identify the exact location where the task is being cancelled.

### **Example Use Case**

Here's an example of how to handle task cancellation:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException;

public class TaskExecutor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a task
        Callable<String> task = () -> {
            // Task execution code
            return "Task result";
        };

        // Submit the task to the thread pool
        Future<String> future = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(task);

        try {
            // Wait for the task to complete
            String result = future.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | TimeoutException e) {
            // Handle task cancellation or timeout
            System.out.println("Task cancelled or timed out");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TaskExecutor` class demonstrates how to handle task cancellation using a `Future` object.
