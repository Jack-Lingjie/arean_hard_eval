**Understanding the Order of Operations**

When dealing with two continuous branch instructions, one in the **ID (Instruction Decode) stage** and the other in the **IF (Instruction Fetch) stage**, it's crucial to understand the order of operations.

### Order of Operations

1.  **Update the First Result**: The first instruction, which is in the ID stage, should be executed first. This means updating its result before proceeding.
2.  **Query the Second Prediction**: After updating the first result, the second instruction, which is in the IF stage, should be queried for its prediction.

### Controlling the Order

To control the order of operations:

-   **Use a Flag**: Set a flag after updating the first result. This flag can be used to indicate that the first result is ready.
-   **Use a Queue**: Place the instructions in a queue. Once the first instruction is updated, move it to the end of the queue. Then, query the second instruction.

### Impact on Prediction Algorithms

-   **Local-Based Prediction Algorithms**: These algorithms rely on the history of recent branch instructions. The order of operations may affect the accuracy of these algorithms.
-   **Global-Based Prediction Algorithms**: These algorithms consider the global history of branch instructions. The order of operations may also impact the accuracy of these algorithms.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have two continuous branch instructions:

-   Instruction 1: `if (x > 5) { ... }`
-   Instruction 2: `if (y > 10) { ... }`

**Step-by-Step Solution**

1.  **Update Instruction 1**: Execute Instruction 1 and update its result.
2.  **Query Instruction 2**: After updating Instruction 1, query Instruction 2 for its prediction.

**Code Example**

```python
def update_and_query(instructions):
    # Update Instruction 1
    instruction1_result = update_instruction(instructions[0])
    
    # Query Instruction 2
    instruction2_prediction = query_instruction(instructions[1])
    
    return instruction1_result, instruction2_prediction

def update_instruction(instruction):
    # Execute the instruction and update its result
    return instruction.execute()

def query_instruction(instruction):
    # Query the instruction for its prediction
    return instruction.predict()
```
