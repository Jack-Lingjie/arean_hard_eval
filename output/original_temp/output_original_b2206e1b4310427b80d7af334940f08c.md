**What is a PayFac Model?**

A PayFac model is a way for companies to process payments. It's like a special tool that helps them accept money from customers.

**How Does it Work?**

- **Payment Processing**: A PayFac model allows companies to process payments directly. This means they can handle transactions without needing a separate payment processor.
- **Merchant of Record**: When a company uses a PayFac model, it becomes the "Merchant of Record." This means they are responsible for the transactions.

**How Does it Differ from a Normal Merchant Acquirer?**

- **Merchant Acquirer**: A normal merchant acquirer is like a middleman. They help companies accept payments by connecting them to banks and payment systems.
- **Key Differences**:
  - **Responsibility**: In a PayFac model, the company is responsible for the transactions. In a normal merchant acquirer model, the acquirer handles this responsibility.
  - **Control**: With a PayFac model, the company has more control over the payment process. They can customize it to fit their needs.

**Example**

- **Company A**: A company uses a PayFac model to sell products online. They become the Merchant of Record.
- **Company B**: A company uses a normal merchant acquirer to sell products online. The acquirer handles the responsibility and control.

**In Summary**

- A PayFac model is a way for companies to process payments directly.
- It makes them the Merchant of Record, giving them more control over the payment process.
- This differs from a normal merchant acquirer, where the acquirer handles the responsibility and control.
