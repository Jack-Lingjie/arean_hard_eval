**To calculate the time it takes to reach 40,000 steps, follow these steps:**

1. **Determine the number of steps taken per 15 minutes**:  
    - You can walk 1700 steps every 15 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total number of 15-minute intervals needed to reach 40,000 steps**:
    - Divide the total steps by the steps per interval:  
        - 40,000 steps / 1700 steps per 15 minutes = 23.53 intervals

3. **Convert the intervals to hours**:
    - Since there are 4 intervals in an hour, multiply the number of intervals by the duration of each interval (15 minutes):
        - 23.53 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 352.95 minutes

4. **Convert minutes to hours**:
    - Divide the total minutes by 60 to get the total hours:
        - 352.95 minutes / 60 = 5.8825 hours

**Therefore, it would take approximately 5 hours and 53 minutes to reach 40,000 steps.**
