**Calculating the Energy Consumption of the Electric Vehicle (EV):**

- **Daily Energy Consumption:** 
  - The EV drives 40 miles per day.
  - It uses 0.3 kWh/mile.
  - Therefore, the daily energy consumption is 40 miles * 0.3 kWh/mile = 12 kWh.

**Calculating the Energy Production from Solar Panels:**

- **Daily Energy Production:** 
  - The solar panels operate at 400 watts.
  - There are 4 peak sun hours per day.
  - Therefore, the daily energy production is 400 watts * 4 hours = 1600 Wh or 1.6 kWh.

**Determining the Number of Solar Panels Needed:**

- **Number of Solar Panels Needed:** 
  - The daily energy consumption of the EV is 12 kWh.
  - The daily energy production from one solar panel is 1.6 kWh.
  - Therefore, the number of solar panels needed is 12 kWh / 1.6 kWh = 7.5.

Since you cannot have a fraction of a solar panel, you would need **8 solar panels** to meet the daily energy needs of the EV.
