**Calculating Gibbs Free Energy of Fibril Formation**

To calculate the Gibbs free energy of fibril formation from a solubility value, follow these steps:

### Step 1: **Understand the Basics**

- **Gibbs Free Energy**: A measure of the energy change in a system at constant temperature and pressure.
- **Solubility**: The maximum amount of a substance that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent.

### Step 2: **Use the Gibbs Free Energy Equation**

The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) can be calculated using the following equation:

\[ \Delta G = -RT \ln K \]

- **R**: The gas constant (approximately 8.314 J/(mol·K)).
- **T**: The temperature in Kelvin.
- **K**: The equilibrium constant.

### Step 3: **Relate Solubility to the Equilibrium Constant**

For a solubility equilibrium, the equilibrium constant (K) is related to the solubility (S) by:

\[ K = \frac{S}{1 - S} \]

### Step 4: **Calculate the Gibbs Free Energy**

Substitute the expression for K into the Gibbs free energy equation:

\[ \Delta G = -RT \ln \left( \frac{S}{1 - S} \right) \]

### Step 5: **Example Calculation**

- **Solubility (S)**: 0.01
- **Temperature (T)**: 298 K
- **Gas Constant (R)**: 8.314 J/(mol·K)

\[ \Delta G = -8.314 \times 298 \times \ln \left( \frac{0.01}{1 - 0.01} \right) \]

\[ \Delta G = -8.314 \times 298 \times \ln \left( \frac{0.01}{0.99} \right) \]

\[ \Delta G = -8.314 \times 298 \times \ln (0.0101) \]

\[ \Delta G = -8.314 \times 298 \times -4.605 \]

\[ \Delta G = 11951.3 \, \text{J/mol} \]

### Step 6: **Interpret the Result**

The calculated Gibbs free energy value indicates the spontaneity of the fibril formation process. A negative value suggests that the process is spontaneous under the given conditions.

### Step 7: **Considerations**

- **Temperature**: The calculation assumes a constant temperature. Changes in temperature can significantly affect the Gibbs free energy.
- **Solubility**: The solubility value used should be accurate and relevant to the specific conditions of the system.

### Step 8: **Conclusion**

Calculating the Gibbs free energy of fibril formation from a solubility value involves understanding the relationship between solubility and the equilibrium constant, and then applying the Gibbs free energy equation. This process provides valuable insights into the spontaneity of fibril formation under specific conditions.
