**Running Multiple Playwright Instances in Parallel on an AWS EC2 Instance**

To achieve this, you'll need to:

1. **Create an EC2 instance** with multiple IP addresses.
2. **Use Terraform to manage the instance** and run the Playwright script in parallel.

### Step 1: Create an EC2 instance with multiple IP addresses

To create an EC2 instance with multiple IP addresses, you'll need to:

- **Create a new VPC** with multiple subnets.
- **Launch an EC2 instance** in each subnet.

### Step 2: Use Terraform to manage the instance and run the Playwright script

**`main.tf`**:

```hcl
# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create a new VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

# Create multiple subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  count             = 10
  cidr_block        = "10.0.${count.index}.0/24"
  availability_zone = "${element(split(",", var.azs), count.index % length(var.azs))}"
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.example.id
}

# Create an EC2 instance in each subnet
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count         = 10
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c71c99" # Ubuntu 20.04
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = element(aws_subnet.example.*.id, count.index)
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.example.id]
}

# Create a security group
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name        = "example-sg"
  description = "Allow inbound traffic on port 22"

  # Allow inbound traffic on port 22
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Run the Playwright script in parallel
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  count = 10

  # Execute the Playwright script
  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    host        = self.public_ip
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/your_private_key")
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "python /path/to/your/script.py",
    ]
  }
}
```

**`variables.tf`**:

```hcl
variable "azs" {
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
}
```

**`terraform init`** and **`terraform apply`** to create the resources.

This setup creates an EC2 instance in each subnet and runs the Playwright script in parallel using `null_resource`. Each instance binds to a different IP address.

**Note**: Replace `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual path to your Playwright script. Also, ensure you have the necessary permissions to create resources in your AWS account.
