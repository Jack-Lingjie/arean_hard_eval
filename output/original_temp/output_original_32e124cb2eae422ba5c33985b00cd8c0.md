To update your Linux Mint system from a backup while preserving disk space by not re-archiving unchanged files, you can use the `tar` command with the following arguments:

```bash
tar --ignore-command-error --sparse-version=1.0 \
    -x -f backup.tar.gz \
    -C / --overwrite-all \
    -X update.list
```

However, the most straightforward approach to update files without re-archiving unchanged files is to use the `--update` or `-U` option. This option tells `tar` to update files only if they have changed.

Here's how you can use it:

```bash
tar --ignore-command-error --sparse-version=1.0 \
    -x -f backup.tar.gz \
    -C / --overwrite-all \
    --update
```

### Explanation:

- **`--ignore-command-error`**: This option tells `tar` to ignore any errors that occur during the extraction process. This is useful because some files might be missing or corrupted.

- **`--sparse-version=1.0`**: This option is used to handle sparse files correctly. It's essential for handling large files efficiently.

- **`-x`**: This option extracts the files from the archive.

- **`-f backup.tar.gz`**: Specifies the archive file to extract from.

- **`-C /`**: This option changes the directory to `/` before extracting the files. This is necessary because `tar` operates relative to the current directory.

- **`--overwrite-all`**: This option forces `tar` to overwrite any existing files.

- **`--update`**: This option tells `tar` to update files only if they have changed.

### Important Notes:

- Make sure to run this command in the root directory (`/`) to update the system correctly.

- Be cautious when using `--overwrite-all` as it can overwrite files without prompting.

- Always test the command in a safe environment before running it on your actual system.

- Ensure you have enough disk space to accommodate the updated files.

This approach efficiently updates your system from the backup while minimizing disk usage.
