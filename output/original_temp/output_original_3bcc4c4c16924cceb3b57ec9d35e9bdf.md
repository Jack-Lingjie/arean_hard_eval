**Deleting a Folder from a Connected Filesystem in Synapse Notebook**

To delete a folder from a connected filesystem in a Synapse Notebook, you can use the following Python code:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete the folder.
- The folder path should be correctly specified.

### Code

```python
# Import the necessary library
import os

# Specify the path to the folder you want to delete
folder_path = "/your/file/system/path/folder_to_delete"

# Check if the folder exists
if os.path.exists(folder_path):
    # Attempt to delete the folder
    try:
        # Use os.rmdir() for empty directories or shutil.rmtree() for directories with contents
        import shutil
        shutil.rmtree(folder_path)
        print(f"Folder '{folder_path}' deleted successfully.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Permission denied to delete folder '{folder_path}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Folder '{folder_path}' does not exist.")
```

### Explanation

- **Importing Libraries**: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries. `os` is used for interacting with the operating system, and `shutil` is used for high-level file operations.
- **Specifying the Folder Path**: Replace `"/your/file/system/path/folder_to_delete"` with the actual path to the folder you want to delete.
- **Checking Folder Existence**: The code checks if the specified folder exists.
- **Deleting the Folder**: If the folder exists, it attempts to delete it. For empty directories, `os.rmdir()` is used. For directories with contents, `shutil.rmtree()` is used.
- **Handling Exceptions**: The code catches `PermissionError` and any other exceptions that might occur during the deletion process.

### Example Use Case

- **Scenario**: You need to delete a folder named `temp_data` located at `/data/temp_data`.
- **Code Modification**: Replace `folder_path` with `"/data/temp_data"`.
- **Execution**: Run the modified code in your Synapse Notebook.

This code provides a basic approach to deleting a folder from a connected filesystem in Synapse. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and handle exceptions appropriately based on your specific use case.
