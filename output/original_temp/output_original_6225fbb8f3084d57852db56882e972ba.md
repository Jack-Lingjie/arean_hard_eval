**Accounting Equation**

The accounting equation is:

Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity

**Changes in Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity**

- Total liabilities decreased by $25,000.
- Stockholders' equity increased by $5,000.

**Impact on Total Assets**

To find the change in total assets, we need to consider the changes in liabilities and stockholders' equity.

- Decrease in liabilities: $25,000
- Increase in stockholders' equity: $5,000

The net change in total assets is the sum of these two changes.

$25,000 (decrease in liabilities) + $5,000 (increase in stockholders' equity) = $30,000

**Direction of Change**

Since the net change is positive ($30,000), the total assets increased.

**Answer**

The total assets increased by $30,000.
