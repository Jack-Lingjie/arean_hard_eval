**Background of the Invention**

The heated grip application for two-wheeled vehicles is a critical component that enhances rider comfort. However, detecting undercurrent faults in this application poses a significant challenge. 

**Problem Statement**

The existing hardware setup for heated grip applications lacks a direct provision to sense the actual current consumption of the coil. This absence necessitates the use of additional components, such as current sensors or shunt resistors, to measure the current and trigger an undercurrent fault.
