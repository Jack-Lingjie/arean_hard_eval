To make a Discord bot play an audio clip using the Discord Interactions API, you will need to follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up Your Bot**

- **Create a Bot Account**: Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
- **Create a Bot**: Under the "Bot" section, click "Add Bot" and then "Yes, do it!" to confirm.
- **Get the Token**: Under the "TOKEN" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot's token. This token is used to authenticate your bot.

### 2. **Invite Your Bot**

- **Create an Invite Link**: Go to the "OAuth2" section and select "bot" under "Scopes."
- **Choose Permissions**: Ensure your bot has the necessary permissions to play audio. Typically, this includes "View Channels" and "Connect."
- **Generate the Invite Link**: Click "Copy" to copy the generated invite link.

### 3. **Use the Discord API**

- **Choose a Programming Language**: Select a language you're comfortable with (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- **Install Required Libraries**: For Python, you'll need `discord.py`. For JavaScript, you'll need `discord.js`.

### 4. **Play the Audio Clip**

- **Send an Audio File**: Use the `send` method to send an audio file to a channel. This can be a direct link to the audio file or the file itself.

### Example with `discord.py`:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

# Initialize the bot
intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.typing = False
intents.presences = False

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)

# Event to indicate the bot is ready
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'{bot.user} has connected to Discord!')

# Command to play an audio clip
@bot.slash_command(name="play_audio", description="Play an audio clip")
async def play_audio(ctx, url: str):
    # Send the audio file
    await ctx.respond(f"Playing audio: {url}")

# Run the bot
bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
```

### Example with `discord.js`:

```javascript
const { Client, SlashCommandBuilder } = require('discord.js');

// Create a new client
const client = new Client({
  intents: [
    // Choose the necessary intents
    'Guilds',
    'GuildMessages',
    'MessageContent',
  ],
});

// Event to indicate the client is ready
client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('Client ready');
});

// Command to play an audio clip
client.on('interactionCreate', (interaction) => {
  if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

  if (interaction.commandName === 'play_audio') {
    // Send the audio file
    interaction.reply(`Playing audio: ${interaction.options.getString('url')}`);
  }
});

// Login to Discord
client.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');
```

### Important Notes:

- Ensure your bot has the necessary permissions to play audio.
- The `play_audio` command in these examples is a basic demonstration. You might need to adjust it based on your specific requirements.
- Always keep your bot token secure.
