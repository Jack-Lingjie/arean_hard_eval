**Preventing the Spread of Germs: High Sneezing and Coughing Etiquette**

### Program Overview

This Python program helps engineers and experts understand and follow high sneezing and coughing etiquette to prevent the spread of germs.

### Code

```python
def germ_prevention_etiquette(action):
    """
    Determine the appropriate action based on the situation.

    Args:
        action (str): The action taken by the individual.

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating the correct etiquette.
    """

    # Define a dictionary to map actions to their corresponding etiquette
    etiquette_guidelines = {
        "sneeze": "Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow.",
        "cough": "Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow.",
        "touch": "Wash your hands immediately.",
        "share": "Avoid sharing personal items.",
        "not_following": "Please follow the guidelines to prevent germ spread."
    }

    # Use a dictionary to handle various cases related to bias
    bias_cases = {
        "sneeze": "If you sneeze, cover your mouth and nose.",
        "cough": "If you cough, cover your mouth and nose.",
        "touch": "If you touch surfaces, wash your hands.",
        "share": "If you're asked to share, politely decline."
    }

    # Check if the action is in the etiquette guidelines
    if action in etiquette_guidelines:
        # Return the corresponding etiquette message
        return etiquette_guidelines[action]
    elif action in bias_cases:
        # Return the corresponding bias case message
        return bias_cases[action]
    else:
        # Return a default message if the action is not recognized
        return "Unknown action. Please try again."


# Example usage:
actions = ["sneeze", "cough", "touch", "share", "not_following"]

for action in actions:
    print(f"**{action.capitalize()}**: {germ_prevention_etiquette(action)}")
```

### Explanation

This program defines a function `germ_prevention_etiquette` that takes an `action` parameter. It uses a dictionary `etiquette_guidelines` to map actions to their corresponding etiquette messages.

The program also includes a dictionary `bias_cases` to handle various cases related to bias. This dictionary provides additional guidance for specific situations.

The function uses an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the correct etiquette message based on the input `action`. If the action is not recognized, it returns a default message.

### Example Use Cases

- **Sneezing**: If you sneeze, cover your mouth and nose.
- **Coughing**: If you cough, cover your mouth and nose.
- **Touching Surfaces**: If you touch surfaces, wash your hands.
- **Sharing Personal Items**: If you're asked to share, politely decline.
- **Not Following Guidelines**: Please follow the guidelines to prevent germ spread.

### Control Flow Logic

The program's control flow logic is clear and well-commented:

- It uses dictionaries to map actions to their corresponding etiquette messages.
- It includes a dictionary to handle various cases related to bias.
- It uses an `if-elif-else` statement to determine the correct etiquette message based on the input `action`.
- It returns a default message if the action is not recognized.

This program provides a clear and concise guide to high sneezing and coughing etiquette, helping engineers and experts prevent the spread of germs.
