**Optimizing Landing Page for Maximum Revenue**

### System Overview

The system aims to optimize landing pages for financial offers, such as selling debit cards, to maximize revenue. It will utilize the following key components:

- **Traffic Flow (TF)**: The volume of visitors to the landing page.
- **Conversions (CV)**: The number of visitors who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase a debit card).
- **Pay Per Click (CPC) Rates (CZ)**: The cost incurred for each click on the landing page.
- **Pay Per Offer (PPA) Rates (PA)**: The revenue generated for each offer completed.

### System Requirements

- **AB Testing**: To compare the performance of different landing page variations.
- **Optimization Algorithm**: To determine the best-performing variation based on revenue.

### System Design

#### 1. Data Collection

- **Traffic Flow (TF)**: Collect the number of visitors to each landing page variation.
- **Conversions (CV)**: Record the number of successful transactions for each variation.
- **Pay Per Click (CPC) Rates (CZ)**: Store the cost per click for each variation.
- **Pay Per Offer (PPA) Rates (PA)**: Store the revenue generated per offer for each variation.

#### 2. AB Testing

- **Variation Creation**: Design and create multiple landing page variations.
- **Randomized Testing**: Randomly assign visitors to each variation for testing.

#### 3. Optimization Algorithm

- **Thomson Sampling Method**: Apply this method to determine the best-performing variation.

#### 4. Revenue Calculation

- **Revenue Calculation Formula**: Calculate revenue using the formula: `Revenue = (Conversions * Pay Per Offer) - (Traffic Flow * Pay Per Click)`.

### Concept Code

```python
import numpy as np

class LandingPageOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, traffic_flow, conversions, pay_per_click, pay_per_offer):
        """
        Initialize the optimizer.

        Args:
        - traffic_flow (float): The volume of visitors to the landing page.
        - conversions (float): The number of visitors who complete a desired action.
        - pay_per_click (float): The cost incurred for each click on the landing page.
        - pay_per_offer (float): The revenue generated for each offer completed.
        """
        self.traffic_flow = traffic_flow
        self.conversions = conversions
        self.pay_per_click = pay_per_click
        self.pay_per_offer = pay_per_offer

    def calculate_revenue(self):
        """
        Calculate the revenue.

        Returns:
        - float: The calculated revenue.
        """
        return (self.conversions * self.pay_per_offer) - (self.traffic_flow * self.pay_per_click)

    def thomson_sampling(self, num_trials):
        """
        Apply the Thomson sampling method.

        Args:
        - num_trials (int): The number of trials.

        Returns:
        - float: The estimated optimal value.
        """
        estimates = []
        for _ in range(num_trials):
            # Simulate random trials
            trial_traffic_flow = np.random.normal(self.traffic_flow, self.traffic_flow / 10)
            trial_conversions = np.random.normal(self.conversions, self.conversions / 10)
            trial_pay_per_click = np.random.normal(self.pay_per_click, self.pay_per_click / 10)
            trial_pay_per_offer = np.random.normal(self.pay_per_offer, self.pay_per_offer / 10)

            # Calculate revenue for the trial
            trial_revenue = (trial_conversions * trial_pay_per_offer) - (trial_traffic_flow * trial_pay_per_click)

            # Update the estimate
            estimates.append(trial_revenue)

        # Return the estimated optimal value
        return np.mean(estimates)

# Example usage
optimizer = LandingPageOptimizer(
    traffic_flow=1000,
    conversions=50,
    pay_per_click=0.5,
    pay_per_offer=10
)

estimated_optimal_value = optimizer.thomson_sampling(num_trials=1000)
print(f"Estimated Optimal Value: {estimated_optimal_value}")
```

### Conclusion

This system design and code implementation provide a comprehensive approach to optimizing landing pages for maximum revenue. By utilizing the Thomson sampling method, it efficiently determines the best-performing variation based on revenue.
