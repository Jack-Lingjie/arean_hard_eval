**Consecutive Wins by Alice**

The following Python function calculates the longest number of consecutive wins by Alice from a given DataFrame.

### Function Definition

```python
import pandas as pd

def longest_consecutive_wins(df):
    """
    Calculate the longest number of consecutive wins by Alice.

    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing 'date' and 'winner' columns.

    Returns:
    int: The longest number of consecutive wins by Alice.
    """

    # Ensure the 'winner' column is of string type
    df['winner'] = df['winner'].astype(str)

    # Filter the DataFrame for Alice's wins
    alice_wins = df[df['winner'] == 'Alice']

    # Sort the wins by date
    alice_wins = alice_wins.sort_values(by='date')

    # Initialize variables to track the longest streak and current streak
    longest_streak = 0
    current_streak = 1

    # Iterate over the sorted wins
    for i in range(1, len(alice_wins)):
        # Check if the current win is consecutive to the previous one
        if alice_wins.iloc[i]['date'] - alice_wins.iloc[i-1]['date'] == pd.Timedelta(days=1):
            # If consecutive, increment the current streak
            current_streak += 1
        else:
            # If not consecutive, update the longest streak if necessary
            longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)
            # Reset the current streak
            current_streak = 1

    # Update the longest streak one last time
    longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)

    return longest_streak
```

### Example Use Case

```python
# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-05', '2022-01-06', '2022-01-07'],
    'winner': ['Alice', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Alice', 'Alice']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the longest consecutive wins by Alice
longest_streak = longest_consecutive_wins(df)

print(f"Longest consecutive wins by Alice: {longest_streak}")
```

This function first filters the DataFrame for Alice's wins, sorts them by date, and then iterates over the sorted wins to calculate the longest consecutive streak. The example use case demonstrates how to create a sample DataFrame and calculate the longest consecutive wins by Alice.
