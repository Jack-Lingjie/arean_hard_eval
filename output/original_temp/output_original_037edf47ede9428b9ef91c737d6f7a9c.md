**Error Analysis**

The error message `sshd[54785]: error: kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host` indicates a problem with the SSH connection. Here's a breakdown:

- **`sshd[54785]`**: This is the process ID (PID) of the SSH daemon process that encountered the error.
- **`error: kex_exchange_identification`**: This part of the message specifies the type of error. `kex_exchange_identification` refers to the Key Exchange (KEX) identification process, which is a crucial step in establishing a secure SSH connection.
- **`Connection closed by remote host`**: This indicates that the remote host (the server you're trying to connect to) closed the connection.

**Possible Root Causes**

1. **Firewall or Network Issues**:
   - **Firewall Rules**: Ensure that the firewall rules allow incoming SSH connections on the correct port (usually port 22).
   - **Network Connectivity**: Verify that there are no network connectivity issues between your machine and the remote host.

2. **SSH Configuration**:
   - **SSH Port**: If you're using a non-standard SSH port, ensure it's correctly configured on both the client and server sides.
   - **SSH Protocol**: Ensure you're using a compatible SSH protocol version.

3. **Server-Side Issues**:
   - **Server Load**: High server loads can cause the server to close connections.
   - **Server Configuration**: Incorrect server configuration might lead to connection closures.

4. **Client-Side Issues**:
   - **Client Configuration**: Incorrect client configuration might cause the connection to be closed.

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Check Server Logs**: Review the server logs for more detailed information about the connection closure.

2. **Verify Network Connectivity**: Ensure that there are no network connectivity issues.

3. **Test with a Different Client**: Try connecting with a different SSH client to rule out client-side issues.

4. **Check SSH Configuration**: Verify that the SSH configuration is correct on both the client and server sides.

5. **Contact Server Administrator**: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact the server administrator for further assistance.
