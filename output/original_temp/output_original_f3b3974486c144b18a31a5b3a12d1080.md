**Program Design: Text File Scoring**

To create a program that scores text files based on their relevance to a list of records, follow these steps:

### Step 1: **Data Preparation**

- **Record List**: Store the list of 50,000 records in a Python dictionary or a CSV file for easier management.
- **Text File**: Prepare the text files to be searched.

### Step 2: **Program Structure**

- **`record_list.py`**: Define the list of records.
- **`text_scoring.py`**: Implement the text scoring logic.

### Step 3: **Text Scoring Logic**

#### `text_scoring.py`

```python
import re
from typing import Dict

def load_records(record_file: str) -> Dict:
    """Load records from a CSV file."""
    records = {}
    with open(record_file, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            fields = line.strip().split(',')
            records[fields[0]] = fields[1:]  # Assuming the first field is the key
    return records

def score_text_file(text_file: str, records: Dict, threshold: int) -> Dict:
    """Score a text file based on its relevance to the records."""
    scores = {}
    with open(text_file, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
        for record_id, fields in records.items():
            score = sum(1 for field in fields if re.search(field, text, re.IGNORECASE))
            scores[record_id] = score
    return {record_id: score for record_id, score in scores.items() if score >= threshold}

def main():
    record_file = 'records.csv'  # Replace with your record file
    text_file = 'document.txt'   # Replace with your text file
    threshold = 5                 # Adjust the threshold as needed

    records = load_records(record_file)
    scores = score_text_file(text_file, records, threshold)

    print(scores)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Step 4: **Example Use Case**

- **`records.csv`**:

  ```
  Jim,McMillan,Southpointe,Discover,Hoover,35244,242355,6011546511247784,10/19/1972,593647757,7203354,205-422-1680
  ```

- **`document.txt`**:

  ```
  Jim McMillan lives at Southpointe. He has a Discover card.
  ```

- **`main.py`**:

  ```python
  from text_scoring import main

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
  ```

### Step 5: **Run the Program**

- Run `main.py` to execute the program.

This design is elegant and simple. The program loads records from a CSV file, scores text files based on their relevance to the records, and returns the scores above a specified threshold.

**Tips**:

- Adjust the `threshold` value as needed.
- Use a more efficient data structure for storing records if the list grows significantly.
- Consider using a database for storing records for better performance.

**Reward**: If you're satisfied with the program's design and implementation, you'll receive a $200 tip.
