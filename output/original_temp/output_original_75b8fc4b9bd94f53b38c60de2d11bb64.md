**Calculating the Future Value of a Monthly Investment**

To determine the future value of a monthly investment with a 12% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), follow these steps:

1.  **Monthly Investment**: The monthly investment is $70,000.
2.  **Annual Growth Rate**: The CAGR is 12%.
3.  **Time Period**: The investment period is 10 years.

**Using a Compound Interest Formula**

The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

- **A**: The future value of the investment.
- **P**: The principal amount (initial investment).
- **r**: The annual interest rate (in decimal form).
- **n**: The number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- **t**: The time the money is invested for in years.

**Calculating the Future Value**

Given the monthly investment of $70,000, the annual growth rate of 12%, and the investment period of 10 years:

- **P**: $70,000 \* 12 = $840,000 (since it's a monthly investment, we multiply by 12 to get the annual investment)
- **r**: 12% = 0.12
- **n**: 12 (compounded monthly)
- **t**: 10 years

\[ A = 840,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{12}\right)^{12 \times 10} \]

\[ A = 840,000 \left(1 + 0.01\right)^{120} \]

\[ A = 840,000 \left(1.01\right)^{120} \]

\[ A ≈ 840,000 \times 3.212 \]

\[ A ≈ 2,700,480 \]

**Result**

The investment of $70,000 per month for 10 years with a 12% CAGR will grow to approximately **$2,700,480**.
