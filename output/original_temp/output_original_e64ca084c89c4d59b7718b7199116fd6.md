Estimating a machine capacity plan with fundamental unknowns like process times and investment availability can be challenging. Here are some steps to help you approach this problem:

### 1. **Identify the Unknowns**

- **Process Times**: These are the times required to complete specific tasks or operations.
- **Investment Availability**: This refers to the budget or resources available for the planned machine or capacity.

### 2. **Gather Available Data**

- **Historical Data**: If available, use historical data on process times and investments.
- **Industry Benchmarks**: Utilize industry benchmarks for process times and investment requirements.
- **Expert Opinions**: Consult with experts in the field to provide insights.

### 3. **Estimate Process Times**

- **Average Values**: Use average values from historical data or industry benchmarks.
- **Range of Values**: Consider a range of values to account for variability.

### 4. **Estimate Investment Availability**

- **Budget Allocation**: Determine the budget allocated for the planned machine or capacity.
- **Range of Values**: Consider a range of values to account for uncertainty.

### 5. **Communicate Uncertainty**

- **Confidence Intervals**: Use confidence intervals to express the uncertainty in your estimates.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Perform sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in assumptions affect the results.

### 6. **Machine Capacity Plan**

- **Capacity Requirements**: Calculate the required capacity based on the estimated process times and investment availability.
- **Machine Selection**: Select machines that meet the capacity requirements.

### 7. **Uncertainty Value**

- **Range of Values**: Express the uncertainty in the machine capacity plan as a range of values.
- **Confidence Level**: Specify the confidence level associated with the estimated capacity.

### Example

Suppose you're planning to purchase a machine to process tasks. The process time is unknown, but you estimate it to be between 2 and 5 hours based on industry benchmarks.

- **Process Time**: 3.5 hours (average of 2 and 5 hours)
- **Investment Availability**: $10,000 (allocated budget)

**Machine Capacity Plan**:

- **Capacity Requirements**: 10 tasks per day (based on 8 hours of operation)
- **Machine Selection**: Select a machine that can process 10 tasks per day.

**Uncertainty Value**:

- **Range of Values**: 8-12 tasks per day (based on process time uncertainty)
- **Confidence Level**: 80% confidence level associated with the estimated capacity.

By following these steps, you can estimate a machine capacity plan with fundamental unknowns and communicate the approximations as uncertainty values on the result.
