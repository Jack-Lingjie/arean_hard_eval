**Expressing Madame Irma's Statements in First-Order Logic (FOL)**

1. **You have a dog.**
   - `Dog(YOU)`

2. **The person you are looking for buys carrots by the bushel.**
   - `BushelCarrots(ROBIN)`

3. **Anyone who owns a rabbit hates anything that chases any rabbit.**
   - `∀x (Rabbit(x) → ∃y (Chases(y, x) → Hate(x, y)))`

   - `∀x (Dog(x) → ∃y (Rabbit(y) ∧ Chases(x, y)))`

5. **Anyone who buys carrots by the bushel owns either a rabbit or a grocery store.**
   - `∀x (BushelCarrots(x) → (Rabbit(x) ∨ GroceryStore(x)))`

6. **Someone who hates something owned by another person will not date that person.**
   - `∀x ∀y (Hate(x, y) ∧ Owns(y, z) → Not(Dates(x, y)))`
