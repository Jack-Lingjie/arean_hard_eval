**Error Explanation**

The error message indicates that you're expecting a closure that implements the `Fn` trait. However, the provided closure only implements `FnOnce`. This means the closure can only be called once.

**Solution**

To fix this issue, you need to modify the closure to implement the `Fn` trait. This involves changing the closure to capture variables by mutable reference (`&mut`) instead of by value (`&`).

**Example**

Here's an example of how to modify the closure:

```rust
// Before
let closure = || {
    // closure body
};

// After
let closure = move || {
    // closure body
};
```

**Key Changes**

- The `move` keyword is used to capture variables by value.
- The closure now implements the `Fn` trait.

**Alternative Solution**

If you don't need to capture variables by value, you can modify the closure to capture variables by reference (`&`):

```rust
let closure = |x| {
    // closure body
};
```

**Key Changes**

- The closure now captures variables by reference (`&`).
- The closure still implements the `Fn` trait.

**Example Use Case**

Here's an example of using the modified closure:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let closure = |x| x + 1;

    let result = closure(x);
    println!("{}", result); // prints 6
}
```

In this example, the closure captures `x` by reference and returns its value incremented by 1.
