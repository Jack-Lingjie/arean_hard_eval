**Database Documentation Strategy**

### **Database Description**
- **Clear Overview**: Provide a concise summary of the database, highlighting its purpose and key components.
- **Assignment Alignment**: Explain how each table and field align with the assignment's requirements.

### **Assumptions and Additions**
- **Explicit Assumptions**: Document any assumptions made during database design, including data types, field lengths, or optional fields.
- **Justification for Additions**: Explain the rationale behind any additional fields or tables introduced.

### **Reaction Policies**
- **Policy Discussion**: Detail the reaction policies used in the database, such as CASCADE on delete/update, and explain why they were chosen.

### **Table Descriptions and Data Types**
- **Detailed Table Descriptions**: For each table, provide a detailed description including purpose, fields, and data types.
- **Data Type Rationale**: Explain the choice of data types for each field.

### **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**
- **Comprehensive ER Diagram**: Include a detailed ER diagram showcasing table relationships and highlighting primary and foreign keys.
- **Labeling and Legends**: Ensure the ER diagram is well-labeled and includes a legend for symbols used.

### **Stored Procedures Documentation**
- **Insert Procedures**: Clearly document each stored procedure for inserting data into tables.
- **Query Procedures**: Document each query procedure.

**Guidelines for Continuous Documentation**

1. **Assess Each Part of the Assignment**: Evaluate the provided code piece against the assignment guidelines.
2. **Compare Against Documentation and Code**: Compare the documentation with the code to ensure accuracy.
3. **Document Reasons for Choices**: Provide detailed explanations for design decisions and choices made.

**Continuous Documentation Process**

- Update the documentation after each code piece is provided.
- Ensure all relevant sections are addressed.
- Ignore sections not applicable to the current code piece.

This strategy will be used to create and refine the database documentation until it is complete.
