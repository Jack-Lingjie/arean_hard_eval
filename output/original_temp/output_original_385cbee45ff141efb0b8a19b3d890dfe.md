**Troubleshooting Injection Molding Machine Issue**

The oil pump motor and oil pump starting but not generating pressure indicates a potential problem with the system. Here are some steps to help identify the issue:

### **1. Check the Oil Pump**

- **Motor Operation**: Ensure the motor is functioning correctly. If it's not turning on, check the power supply and electrical connections.
- **Pump Operation**: Verify the pump is working. If it's not, inspect the pump for blockages or damage.

### **2. Pressure Gauge**

- **Check the Pressure Gauge**: Ensure the pressure gauge is functioning correctly. If it's not showing any pressure, check the gauge for blockages or damage.

### **3. Oil Flow**

- **Check Oil Flow**: Verify oil is flowing from the pump to the system. If not, inspect the oil lines for blockages or damage.

### **4. System Leaks**

- **Check for Leaks**: Inspect the system for any signs of leaks. Leaks can prevent pressure from building up.

### **5. Oil Level**

- **Check Oil Level**: Ensure the oil level is at the recommended level. Low oil levels can prevent the pump from generating pressure.

### **6. Pump Settings**

- **Check Pump Settings**: Verify the pump settings are correct. Incorrect settings can prevent the pump from generating pressure.

### **7. System Blockages**

- **Check for Blockages**: Inspect the system for any blockages. Blockages can prevent pressure from building up.

### **8. Consult the Manual**

- **Consult the Manual**: Refer to the machine's manual for troubleshooting guides specific to the oil pump system.

### **9. Contact the Manufacturer**

- **Contact the Manufacturer**: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact the machine's manufacturer for further assistance.

### **10. Professional Assistance**

- **Seek Professional Help**: If the issue persists, consider seeking the help of a professional engineer or the machine's manufacturer for further assistance.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and potentially resolve the issue with your injection molding machine's oil pump system.
