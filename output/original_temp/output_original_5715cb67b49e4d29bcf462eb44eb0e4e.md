**Proof of Infinitely Many Irrational Numbers**

To prove that there are infinitely many irrational numbers, consider the following steps:

### Step 1: **Definition of Irrational Numbers**

- **Irrational numbers** are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction.

### Step 2: **Existence of Rational Numbers**

- **Rational numbers** are real numbers that can be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction.

### Step 3: **Proof of Infinitely Many Irrational Numbers**

- **Step 3.1**: Assume there are only a finite number of irrational numbers.

- **Step 3.2**: List all the irrational numbers in a set \(I\).

- **Step 3.3**: Consider the set of all real numbers, which includes both rational and irrational numbers.

- **Step 3.4**: Since the set of real numbers is uncountably infinite, there must be real numbers not in the set \(I\).

- **Step 3.5**: These real numbers not in \(I\) are also irrational.

- **Step 3.6**: This contradicts the assumption that there are only a finite number of irrational numbers.
