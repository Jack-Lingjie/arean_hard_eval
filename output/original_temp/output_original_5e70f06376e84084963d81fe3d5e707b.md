**Upgrading Symfony 4 to 5: Resolving Version Conflicts**

When upgrading from Symfony 4 to 5, you may encounter version conflicts. This issue arises from the `composer.json` file, which specifies dependencies.

### The Problem

The error message indicates:

```bash
Root composer.json requires symfony/security 5.0.*, 
found symfony/security[2.0.4, ..., 2.8.x-dev, v3.0.0-BETA1, ..., 3.4.x-dev, v4.0.0-BETA1, ..., 4.4.x-dev] 
but it does not match the constraint.
```

### Solution

To resolve this conflict:

1. **Update the `symfony/security` constraint** in your `composer.json` file:

    ```json
    "require": {
        "symfony/security": "^5.0"
    },
    ```

2. **Run `composer update`** to update all dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer update
    ```

### Explanation

- **Update the `symfony/security` constraint**: Change the version constraint to `^5.0` to require the latest version of Symfony Security 5.
- **Run `composer update`**: This command updates all dependencies to their latest versions, ensuring compatibility with Symfony 5.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a project with the following `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "symfony/security": "^4.4"
    }
}
```

To upgrade to Symfony 5, update the `symfony/security` constraint:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "symfony/security": "^5.0"
    }
}
```

Then, run `composer update` to ensure all dependencies are updated to their latest versions.
