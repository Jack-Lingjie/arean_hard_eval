To make a MATLAB script wait until the user closes all open figures before continuing, you can use a loop that checks for the presence of open figure windows. Here is a sample code snippet that accomplishes this:

```MATLAB
while ~isempty(findall(0, 'Type', 'figure'))
    pause(1); % Pause for 1 second to avoid excessive CPU usage
end
```

Explanation:
- `findall(0, 'Type', 'figure')` returns a list of all figure objects.
- `isempty` checks if this list is empty.
- The `while` loop continues to run as long as there are open figures.
- `pause(1)` pauses the loop for 1 second on each iteration to prevent excessive CPU usage.

This code ensures that the script waits until all figures are closed before proceeding.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Assistant A's Answer:
Assistant A provided the following code:
```MATLAB
while ~isempty(findall(0, 'Type', 'figure'))
    pause(1);
end
```
- This code correctly checks for open figures using `findall(0, 'Type', 'figure')`.
- The `pause(1)` command is used to prevent excessive CPU usage, which is a good practice.
- The explanation is clear and concise.

### Assistant B's Answer:
Assistant B provided the following code:
```MATLAB
while get(0, 'Visible') 
    % Do nothing, wait for user to close all figures
end
```
- This code uses `get(0, 'Visible')` to check for visible figures, which is incorrect. The `Visible` property of the root object (0) does not indicate the presence of open figures.
- The explanation is clear but based on an incorrect method.
- The example use case is helpful but also based on the incorrect method.

### Evaluation:
- Assistant A's answer is correct and provides a proper method to check for open figures.
- Assistant B's answer is incorrect because it uses an inappropriate property (`Visible`) to check for open figures.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A provided the correct and more helpful answer.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
