Here is a Python program to play Connect-4 in the terminal:

```python
import numpy as np

ROWS = 6
COLUMNS = 7
CONNECT = 4

def create_board():
    return np.zeros((ROWS, COLUMNS))

def is_valid_location(board, col):
    return board[ROWS-1][col] == 0

def get_next_open_row(board, col):
    for row in range(ROWS):
        if board[row][col] == 0:
            return row

def drop_piece(board, row, col, piece):
    board[row][col] = piece

def is_winning_move(board, piece):
    for c in range(COLUMNS - CONNECT + 1):
        for r in range(ROWS):
            if np.all(board[r, c:c+CONNECT] == piece):
                return True

    for c in range(COLUMNS):
        for r in range(ROWS - CONNECT + 1):
            if np.all(board[r:r+CONNECT, c] == piece):
                return True

    for c in range(COLUMNS - CONNECT + 1):
        for r in range(ROWS - CONNECT + 1):
            if np.all(np.diag(board[r:r+CONNECT, c:c+CONNECT]) == piece):
                return True

    for c in range(COLUMNS - CONNECT + 1):
        for r in range(CONNECT - 1, ROWS):
            if np.all(np.diag(np.fliplr(board[r-CONNECT+1:r+1, c:c+CONNECT])) == piece):
                return True

    return False

def print_board(board):
    print(np.flip(board, 0))

board = create_board()
game_over = False
turn = 0

print_board(board)

while not game_over:
    if turn == 0:
        col = int(input("Player 1, make your move (0-6): "))
        piece = 1
    else:
        col = int(input("Player 2, make your move (0-6): "))
        piece = 2

    if is_valid_location(board, col):
        row = get_next_open_row(board, col)
        drop_piece(board, row, col, piece)

        if is_winning_move(board, piece):
            print(f"Player {piece} wins!")
            game_over = True

        print_board(board)
        turn = (turn + 1) % 2
```

To play the game, copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., `connect4.py`) and run it using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python connect4.py`). The game will be played in the terminal, with players taking turns to input their moves.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:

1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant A is correct and functional. It uses numpy for board representation and includes all necessary functions to play Connect-4.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response is helpful as it provides a complete, working program.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:

1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant B is also correct and functional. It uses a list of lists for board representation and includes all necessary functions to play Connect-4.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response is helpful as it provides a complete, working program.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is slightly more verbose due to additional explanations and advice.

### Comparison:

- Both answers provide a correct and functional Connect-4 game implementation.
- Assistant A's answer is more concise and directly to the point.
- Assistant B's answer includes additional explanations and advice, which might be useful for some users but makes the response slightly more verbose.

Given that both answers are correct and functional, but Assistant A's answer is more concise and directly addresses the prompt without additional verbosity, I would rate Assistant A's answer slightly better.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
