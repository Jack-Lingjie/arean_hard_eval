To calculate the future value of a monthly investment with a compounded annual growth return (CAGR) of 12% over 10 years, we need to use the future value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula is:

\[ FV = P \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right) \]

Where:
- \( FV \) = future value of the investment
- \( P \) = periodic investment (70,000 per month)
- \( r \) = interest rate per period (monthly rate)
- \( n \) = total number of periods (months)

First, we need to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate:
\[ r = \frac{12\%}{12} = 0.01 \text{ (or 1% per month)} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of periods:
\[ n = 10 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:
\[ FV = 70,000 \times \left( \frac{(1 + 0.01)^{120} - 1}{0.01} \right) \]

Calculating the values inside the formula:
\[ (1 + 0.01)^{120} = (1.01)^{120} \approx 3.30039 \]

\[ FV = 70,000 \times \left( \frac{3.30039 - 1}{0.01} \right) \]

\[ FV = 70,000 \times \left( \frac{2.30039}{0.01} \right) \]

\[ FV = 70,000 \times 230.039 \]

\[ FV \approx 16,102,730 \]

So, if you invest 70,000 per month with a compounded annual growth return of 12%, your investment will grow to approximately 16,102,730 in 10 years.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Assistant A's Answer:
- Correctly identifies the need to use the future value of an ordinary annuity formula.
- Correctly converts the annual interest rate to a monthly rate.
- Correctly calculates the total number of periods.
- Makes a calculation error in the final steps, resulting in an incorrect future value.

### Assistant B's Answer:
- Uses a different approach by treating the monthly investment as an annual lump sum, which is incorrect for this scenario.
- Incorrectly calculates the future value by not using the correct formula for monthly investments.
- The final value is significantly off due to the incorrect approach.

### Evaluation:
- Assistant A's approach is closer to the correct method but contains a calculation error.
- Assistant B's approach is fundamentally flawed for this type of problem.

Given the above analysis, Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the correct methodology, despite the calculation error.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
