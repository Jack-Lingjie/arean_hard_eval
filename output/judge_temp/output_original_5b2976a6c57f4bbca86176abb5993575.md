To correctly report the GST/HST portion of your airfare expense, you need to identify the specific amount of GST/HST charged on your invoice. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the information provided:

1. **Base Fare (CAD):** $164.99
2. **Total V.A.T/G.S.T/H.S.T.:** $15.00
3. **Other Taxes:** $132.12
4. **Total Invoice:** $312.11

The **Total V.A.T/G.S.T/H.S.T.** amount of $15.00 is the GST/HST portion of your expense. This is the amount you should report in your company's expense report as the GST/HST portion. 

The **Other Taxes** of $132.12 likely include various other fees and surcharges such as airport improvement fees, security charges, and other government-imposed taxes, which are not part of the GST/HST.

To summarize, you should report the $15.00 as the GST/HST portion of your airfare expense in your company's expense report.
