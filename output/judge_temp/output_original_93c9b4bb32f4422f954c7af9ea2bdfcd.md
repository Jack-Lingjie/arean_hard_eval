To detect and remove 1-pixel width white horizontal lines from a black and white image, you can use image processing libraries like OpenCV in Python. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install OpenCV**: If you haven't already installed OpenCV, you can do so using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. **Read the Image**: Load the image using OpenCV's `cv2.imread()` function.
   ```python
   import cv2

   image = cv2.imread('input_image.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
   ```

3. **Detect and Remove Horizontal Lines**: Iterate through each row of the image. If a row contains only white pixels (255), set the pixel values to black (0).
   ```python
   for i in range(image.shape[0]):
       if all(image[i, :] == 255):
           image[i, :] = 0
   ```

4. **Save the Output Image**: Save the processed image using the `cv2.imwrite()` function.
   ```python
   cv2.imwrite('output_image.png', image)
   ```

Here is the complete code:
```python
import cv2

def remove_horizontal_lines(image_path, output_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

    for i in range(image.shape[0]):
        if all(image[i, :] == 255):
            image[i, :] = 0

    cv2.imwrite(output_path, image)

# Usage
remove_horizontal_lines('input_image.png', 'output_image.png')
```

This code will detect and remove 1-pixel width white horizontal lines from the input image and save the result in the output image.

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: Install OpenCV if it is not already installed.
- **Step 2**: Load the image in grayscale mode.
- **Step 3**: Iterate through each row of the image. If a row is entirely white, change it to black.
- **Step 4**: Save the modified image.

This method is straightforward and efficient for the specific task of removing 1-pixel width white horizontal lines from a black and white image.
