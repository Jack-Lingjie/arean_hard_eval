In Akkadian, indirect objects were typically expressed using prepositions, most commonly "ana" (to, for) or "ina" (in, on), followed by the noun in the genitive case. This method functioned similarly to the dative case in other languages.

Here is an example sentence with a subject, a direct object, and an indirect object:

Akkadian: šarrum šapāram ana ilim nadānum
Interlinear gloss:
šarrum      šapāram      ana      ilim      nadānum
king-NOM   letter-ACC   to/for   god-GEN   give-INF

Translation: The king gives the letter to the god.

In this example:
- "šarrum" (king) is the subject in the nominative case.
- "šapāram" (letter) is the direct object in the accusative case.
- "ilim" (god) is the indirect object in the genitive case, preceded by the preposition "ana" (to, for).

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: Assistant A correctly identifies that Akkadian uses prepositions like "ana" to express indirect objects and provides an accurate example.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response is helpful and directly addresses the user's question.
3. **Relevance**: The example provided is relevant and demonstrates the use of noun cases and prepositions in Akkadian.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.
5. **Accuracy**: The interlinear gloss and translation are mostly accurate, though there is a minor error in the glossing of "šapārum" (it should be "letter-ACC" instead of "send-ACC").

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: Assistant B incorrectly states that indirect objects are expressed using the particle "ša," which is not accurate for this context. "ša" is used for possessive constructions, not for indicating indirect objects.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response is less helpful because it provides incorrect information about how indirect objects are expressed in Akkadian.
3. **Relevance**: The example provided is not relevant to the user's question about indirect objects.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is somewhat verbose and includes unnecessary details.
5. **Accuracy**: The interlinear gloss and translation are incorrect and do not accurately reflect the use of noun cases and prepositions in Akkadian.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A provides a more accurate and relevant response to the user's question, while Assistant B's response contains significant inaccuracies and irrelevant information.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
