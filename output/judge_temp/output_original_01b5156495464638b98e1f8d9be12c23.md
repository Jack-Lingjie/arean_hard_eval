To address the issue where your chatbot outputs "### Instruction: <all of its instructions>" after resizing its context memory, it is important to understand the likely causes and potential solutions.

### Likely Causes:
1. **Context Memory Handling**: When the context memory is resized, the chatbot might inadvertently include internal instructions in the output due to improper handling of memory or data structures.
2. **Instruction Formatting**: The way instructions are formatted or stored might lead to them being appended to the output text when the context is resized.
3. **Code Logic**: There might be a logical error in the code that processes the context memory, causing it to output instructions unintentionally.

### Solutions:
1. **Review Code for Context Memory Handling**:
   - Check the sections of the code responsible for resizing the context memory. Ensure that instructions are not being appended to the output text during this process.
   - Verify that the context memory is being managed correctly and that instructions are stored separately from the response data.

2. **Proper Formatting and Separation**:
   - Ensure that instructions are clearly separated from the response text using appropriate delimiters or data structures.
   - Use distinct variables or objects to store instructions and responses to avoid any overlap.

3. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - Implement logging to track the chatbot's behavior during context memory resizing. This can help identify where the instructions are being appended to the output.
   - Use debugging tools to step through the code and observe the state of the context memory and output at each step.

4. **Framework or Library Documentation**:
   - If you are using a pre-built chatbot framework or library, consult the documentation for any known issues related to context memory resizing and output formatting.
   - Follow recommended practices for handling instructions and context memory within the framework.

5. **Community Support**:
   - Reach out to the support team or community forums of the chatbot framework for assistance. They may have encountered similar issues and can provide guidance on resolving the problem.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and rectify the issue causing your chatbot to output internal instructions after resizing its context memory.
