To simulate a ballistic projectile in non-uniform gravity, we need to account for the variation in gravitational acceleration with altitude. This can be done using numerical integration methods. Below is a Python code example using the Euler method to simulate such a scenario:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
g0 = 9.81  # m/s^2, standard gravity at Earth's surface
R_earth = 6371000  # m, Earth's radius
dt = 0.01  # s, time step
v0 = 100  # m/s, initial velocity
angle = 45  # degrees, launch angle
simulation_time = 20  # s, total simulation time

# Functions
def gravity(y):
    return g0 * (R_earth / (R_earth + y))**2

def euler_step(x, y, vx, vy):
    ax = 0
    ay = -gravity(y)
    x_new = x + vx * dt
    y_new = y + vy * dt
    vx_new = vx + ax * dt
    vy_new = vy + ay * dt
    return x_new, y_new, vx_new, vy_new

# Initial conditions
x, y = 0, 0
vx, vy = v0 * np.cos(np.radians(angle)), v0 * np.sin(np.radians(angle))
trajectory = [(x, y)]

# Simulation loop
for _ in range(int(simulation_time / dt)):
    x, y, vx, vy = euler_step(x, y, vx, vy)
    trajectory.append((x, y))
    if y < 0:
        break

# Plotting
trajectory = np.array(trajectory)
plt.plot(trajectory[:, 0], trajectory[:, 1])
plt.xlabel("x (m)")
plt.ylabel("y (m)")
plt.title("Projectile motion in non-uniform gravity")
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This code simulates a projectile launched with an initial velocity of 100 m/s at a 45-degree angle. The simulation runs for 20 seconds or until the projectile hits the ground. The non-uniform gravity is modeled as a function of altitude, considering Earth's radius. The Euler method is used for numerical integration, and the resulting trajectory is plotted using matplotlib.
