To generate a prime number stream in Rust, you can use an iterator that yields prime numbers on demand. Here is a simple implementation:

First, add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file if you want to use external crates (though the example below does not require any):

```toml
[dependencies]
```

Now, you can create a prime number stream using the following Rust code:

```rust
fn is_prime(n: u64) -> bool {
    if n <= 1 {
        return false;
    }
    for i in 2..=((n as f64).sqrt() as u64) {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return false;
        }
    }
    true
}

struct PrimeStream {
    current: u64,
}

impl PrimeStream {
    fn new() -> Self {
        PrimeStream { current: 1 }
    }
}

impl Iterator for PrimeStream {
    type Item = u64;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.current += 1;
        while !is_prime(self.current) {
            self.current += 1;
        }
        Some(self.current)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let prime_stream = PrimeStream::new();
    for prime in prime_stream.take(10) {
        println!("{}", prime);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **`is_prime` Function**: This function checks whether a given number is prime. It returns `false` for numbers less than or equal to 1. For other numbers, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.
- **`PrimeStream` Struct**: This struct holds the current number being checked.
- **`Iterator` Implementation**: The `next` method increments the current number and checks if it is prime. If not, it continues to the next number until it finds a prime.
- **`main` Function**: In the `main` function, we create a `PrimeStream` and print the first 10 prime numbers.

This code does not require any external crates and demonstrates how to generate a stream of prime numbers using Rust's iterator pattern.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation

**Assistant A's Answer:**
1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant A is correct and uses the `primal` crate to generate prime numbers.
2. **Dependencies**: It correctly specifies the dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.
3. **Concurrency**: Uses `lazy_static` and `Mutex` to handle concurrency, which is a bit more advanced and may not be necessary for a simple prime number stream.
4. **Explanation**: The explanation is clear and concise.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant B has a logical error. The `prime_stream` function is not correctly implemented as an iterator. The `move || { ... }` syntax is incorrect for defining an iterator.
2. **Helper Function**: The `is_prime` function is correctly implemented.
3. **Explanation**: The explanation is detailed but the code itself is flawed.

### Verdict

Assistant A's answer is more accurate and functional compared to Assistant B's answer, which contains a significant error in the implementation of the prime number stream.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
