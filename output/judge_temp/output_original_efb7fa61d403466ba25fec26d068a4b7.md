To accurately measure the profit or loss while dollar-cost averaging in stocks, you can follow these steps:

1. **Track Investments**: Record each investment you make, including the date, the amount invested, the number of shares purchased, and the price per share.

2. **Calculate Total Amount Invested**: Sum up all the amounts you have invested over time.

3. **Calculate Total Shares Purchased**: Sum up the total number of shares you have purchased over time.

4. **Calculate Average Cost Per Share**: Divide the total amount invested by the total number of shares purchased. This gives you the average cost per share.

5. **Calculate Current Value of Investment**: Multiply the total number of shares you own by the current market price per share. This gives you the current value of your investment.

6. **Calculate Profit or Loss**: Subtract the total amount invested from the current value of your investment. If the result is positive, you have a profit; if negative, you have a loss.

7. **Calculate Percentage Return**: Divide the profit or loss by the total amount invested and multiply by 100 to get the percentage return on your investment.

Example:
- **Investment 1**: $100 at $50/share = 2 shares
- **Investment 2**: $100 at $25/share = 4 shares
- **Investment 3**: $100 at $20/share = 5 shares

Total amount invested = $300
Total shares purchased = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 shares
Average cost per share = $300 / 11 â‰ˆ $27.27

If the current market price is $30/share:
Current value of investment = 11 shares * $30/share = $330
Profit = $330 - $300 = $30
Percentage return = ($30 / $300) * 100 = 10%

This method provides a snapshot of your profit or loss at a specific point in time and helps you understand the performance of your investment strategy.
