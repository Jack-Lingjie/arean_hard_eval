To address the user prompt, we need to create a Python script using object-oriented programming (OOP) to implement a contextual multi-armed bandit with three models. Here is a sample implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

class Model:
    def __init__(self, n_features):
        self.n_features = n_features
        self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)

    def predict(self, context):
        return np.dot(self.weights, context)

    def update(self, context, reward, learning_rate=0.1):
        prediction = self.predict(context)
        error = reward - prediction
        self.weights += learning_rate * error * context

class ContextualBandit:
    def __init__(self, n_arms, n_features):
        self.n_arms = n_arms
        self.models = [Model(n_features) for _ in range(n_arms)]

    def choose_arm(self, context):
        predictions = [model.predict(context) for model in self.models]
        return np.argmax(predictions)

    def update(self, chosen_arm, context, reward):
        self.models[chosen_arm].update(context, reward)

def generate_context(n_features):
    return np.random.rand(n_features)

def generate_reward(arm, context):
    true_weights = [np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), np.array([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]), np.array([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])]
    return np.dot(true_weights[arm], context) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1)

def main():
    n_arms = 3
    n_features = 5
    n_rounds = 1000

    bandit = ContextualBandit(n_arms, n_features)

    for _ in range(n_rounds):
        context = generate_context(n_features)
        chosen_arm = bandit.choose_arm(context)
        reward = generate_reward(chosen_arm, context)
        bandit.update(chosen_arm, context, reward)

    print("Final model weights:")
    for i, model in enumerate(bandit.models):
        print(f"Arm {i}: {model.weights}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and Assistant B's Answers

**Assistant A's Answer:**
1. **Correctness:** The implementation is correct and follows the prompt requirements. It uses OOP to create a contextual multi-armed bandit with three models.
2. **Helpfulness:** The answer is helpful and provides a complete script that includes context generation, reward generation, and the main loop for running the bandit algorithm.
3. **Relevance:** The answer is relevant to the prompt and includes all necessary components.
4. **Conciseness:** The answer is concise and does not include unnecessary information.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
1. **Correctness:** The implementation is correct but deviates from the prompt by introducing different types of models (Linear, Logistic, Random) instead of three instances of the same model type.
2. **Helpfulness:** The answer is helpful but may be confusing due to the introduction of different model types, which was not specified in the prompt.
3. **Relevance:** The answer is somewhat relevant but does not strictly follow the prompt's requirement of using three models in a contextual multi-armed bandit.
4. **Conciseness:** The answer is concise but includes additional complexity that may not be necessary.

### Final Verdict
Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the prompt's requirements and provides a straightforward implementation of a contextual multi-armed bandit with three models. Assistant B's answer, while correct, introduces additional complexity that was not requested.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
