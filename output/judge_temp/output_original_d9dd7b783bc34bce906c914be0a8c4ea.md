To prove the converse of Proposition 1.2.8, we need to show that if \( b_0 \) is an upper bound of \( S \) and satisfies the given condition (1), then \( b_0 \) is the least upper bound (supremum) of \( S \).

Recall the definition of supremum: A number \( b \) is the supremum of a set \( S \) if it is an upper bound of \( S \) and for any other upper bound \( b' \), \( b \leq b' \).

We are given that \( b_0 \) is an upper bound of \( S \), so we just need to show that for any other upper bound \( b' \), \( b_0 \leq b' \).

Let \( b' \) be any other upper bound of \( S \). We want to show that \( b_0 \leq b' \). Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \( b_0 > b' \). Then, we can find a positive \( \epsilon \) such that \( b_0 - \epsilon > b' \). Since \( b' \) is an upper bound of \( S \), this means that \( b_0 - \epsilon \) is also an upper bound of \( S \).

However, according to condition (1), for any \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists an \( x \in S \) such that \( x > b_0 - \epsilon \). This means that there exists an element \( x \) in \( S \) that is greater than the upper bound \( b_0 - \epsilon \), which is a contradiction since \( b_0 - \epsilon \) is supposed to be an upper bound of \( S \).

Therefore, our assumption that \( b_0 > b' \) must be false, and we conclude that \( b_0 \leq b' \). Since this holds for any other upper bound \( b' \), \( b_0 \) is the least upper bound (supremum) of \( S \), and we have proven the converse of Proposition 1.2.8:

If \( b_0 \) is an upper bound of \( S \) and satisfies condition (1), then \( b_0 = \sup S \).

**Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:**

Assistant A's answer is clear and follows a logical structure. It correctly identifies the need to show that \( b_0 \) is the least upper bound by proving that any other upper bound \( b' \) must be greater than or equal to \( b_0 \). The proof by contradiction is well-explained and correctly applies the given condition to reach the conclusion.

**Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:**

Assistant B's answer is also clear and logically structured. It breaks down the proof into steps, which can be helpful for understanding. The steps are correct and lead to the conclusion that \( b_0 \) is the least upper bound. However, the explanation is slightly less detailed than Assistant A's, particularly in the reasoning behind the contradiction.

**Comparison:**

Both answers are correct and logically sound. However, Assistant A provides a slightly more detailed explanation, particularly in the reasoning behind the contradiction. Assistant B's step-by-step approach is clear but slightly less detailed in the critical part of the proof.

**Final Verdict:**

Assistant A is slightly better: [[A>B]]
