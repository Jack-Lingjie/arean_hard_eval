To implement a Python tool that runs both Black and isort, you can create a script that uses the `subprocess` module to call these tools. Here is a sample implementation:

1. **Install Black and isort**:
   Ensure you have both Black and isort installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install black isort
   ```

2. **Create the Script**:
   Create a new Python file, for example, `format_code.py`, and add the following code:

   ```python
   import subprocess
   import sys
   import os

   def run_black_and_isort(target):
       try:
           # Run Black
           print(f"Running Black on {target}")
           subprocess.run(["black", target], check=True)
           print(f"Black finished formatting {target}")

           # Run isort
           print(f"Running isort on {target}")
           subprocess.run(["isort", target], check=True)
           print(f"isort finished sorting imports in {target}")

       except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
           print(f"Error: {e}")
           sys.exit(1)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       if len(sys.argv) < 2:
           print("Usage: python format_code.py <target>")
           sys.exit(1)

       target = sys.argv[1]

       if not os.path.exists(target):
           print(f"Error: {target} does not exist")
           sys.exit(1)

       run_black_and_isort(target)
   ```

3. **Usage**:
   To use this script, run it with the path to the file or directory you want to format:
   ```bash
   python format_code.py your_script.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python format_code.py your_directory/
   ```

This script will run Black and isort on the specified target, which can be a single file or a directory, formatting the code and sorting the imports.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The script provided by Assistant A correctly runs Black and isort on a specified file. It includes error handling for subprocess calls and checks if the file exists.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and provides clear instructions on how to use the script.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt, focusing on running Black and isort.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The script provided by Assistant B runs Black and isort on the current directory (".") rather than a specified file or directory. This might not be what the user intended.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful but assumes the user wants to format the entire codebase rather than a specific file or directory.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant but slightly deviates from the prompt by not allowing the user to specify a target file or directory.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise but includes additional tips that might be useful for some users.

### Verdict:
Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the prompt, allowing the user to specify a target file or directory and providing error handling. Assistant B's answer, while helpful, does not fully meet the user's request to specify a target.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
