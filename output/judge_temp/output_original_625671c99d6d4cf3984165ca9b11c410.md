To create a media entity in Drupal, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Enable Required Modules
Ensure that the necessary modules are enabled. For Drupal 8.4 and later, the Media and Media Library modules are included in the core.

1. **Navigate to the Modules Page**: Go to **Extend** in the Drupal administration menu.
2. **Enable the Media Module**: Check the box next to "Media" and "Media Library" to enable them.

### Step 2: Create a Media Type
A media type defines the fields and settings for a specific type of media entity.

1. **Navigate to Media Types**: Go to **Structure > Media types**.
2. **Add Media Type**: Click on **Add media type**.
3. **Configure Media Type**:
   - **Name**: Enter a name for the media type.
   - **Description**: Optionally, add a description.
   - **Media Source**: Choose a media source plugin (e.g., Image, Video, Remote video).
4. **Save**: Click **Save** to create the media type.

### Step 3: Add Fields to the Media Type
You can add additional fields to store metadata or other information.

1. **Manage Fields**: Go to **Structure > Media types**, and click **Manage fields** next to the media type you created.
2. **Add Field**: Click **Add field** and choose the field type.
3. **Configure Field**: Set the field settings and save.

### Step 4: Configure Form Display
Customize the form used to create and edit media entities.

1. **Manage Form Display**: Go to **Structure > Media types**, and click **Manage form display** next to the media type.
2. **Arrange Fields**: Arrange and configure the fields as needed.
3. **Save**: Save the form display configuration.

### Step 5: Configure Display
Customize how media entities are displayed.

1. **Manage Display**: Go to **Structure > Media types**, and click **Manage display** next to the media type.
2. **Arrange Fields**: Arrange and configure the fields as needed.
3. **Save**: Save the display configuration.

### Step 6: Create a Media Entity
Now that you have a media type, you can create media entities.

1. **Add Media**: Go to **Content > Media > Add media**, and choose the media type.
2. **Fill in Fields**: Complete the fields, including uploading or selecting the media item.
3. **Save**: Save the media entity.

### Step 7: Embed Media Entity in Content
To use the media entity in your content, you can add a media reference field to a content type or use the media library in a text editor.

1. **Add Media Reference Field**:
   - Go to **Structure > Content types > [Your content type] > Manage fields**.
   - Add a new field of type **Reference > Media**.
   - Configure the field settings and save.
2. **Use Media Library**:
   - Ensure the **Media Library** module is enabled.
   - Configure the text format to include the **Embed media** button.
   - Use the button to browse and embed media entities when editing content.

By following these steps, you can successfully create and manage media entities in Drupal.
