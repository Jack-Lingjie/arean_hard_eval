### My Answer to the Prompt:

As an AI, I cannot directly navigate to web pages or extract data from them. However, I can guide you on how to achieve this using web scraping techniques. Here is a step-by-step guide using Python and BeautifulSoup:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script:**
   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   import csv

   url = 'https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html?lang=en'

   response = requests.get(url)
   soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

   # Assuming the menu items are within a specific class or id
   menu_items = soup.select('.side-nav .side-nav-item')

   with open('menu_labels_and_urls.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
       fieldnames = ['menu_label', 'url']
       writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
       writer.writeheader()

       for item in menu_items:
           label = item.get_text(strip=True)
           link = item.find('a')['href']
           full_url = f'https://experienceleague.adobe.com{link}'
           writer.writerow({'menu_label': label, 'url': full_url})

   print("CSV file created successfully.")
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   Save the script to a file, for example, `extract_menu.py`, and run it using:
   ```bash
   python extract_menu.py
   ```

This script will create a CSV file named `menu_labels_and_urls.csv` containing the menu labels and their corresponding URLs. Note that this script may need adjustments based on the actual HTML structure of the webpage.
