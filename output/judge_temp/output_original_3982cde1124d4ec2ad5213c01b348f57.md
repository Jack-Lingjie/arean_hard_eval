To generate a bass line based on a key signature, chord progression, and number of bars in Python, you can use the `music21` library, which is designed for handling music theory and composition tasks. Here is a sample implementation:

```python
from music21 import stream, note, chord, key

def generate_bass_line(key_signature, chord_progression, num_bars):
    # Define the key
    k = key.Key(key_signature)
    
    # Create a stream to store the bass line
    bass_line = stream.Stream()
    
    # Generate the bass line
    for i in range(num_bars):
        current_chord = chord.Chord(chord_progression[i % len(chord_progression)])
        current_chord = current_chord.closedPosition(forceOctave=2)  # Place chord in bass octave
        bass_note = current_chord.bass()  # Get the bass note of the chord
        bass_line.append(note.Note(bass_note, type='quarter'))
    
    return bass_line

# Example usage
key_signature = 'C'
chord_progression = ['C', 'Am', 'F', 'G']
num_bars = 16

bass_line = generate_bass_line(key_signature, chord_progression, num_bars)
bass_line.show('text')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Key Signature**: The `key.Key` object is used to define the key signature.
2. **Chord Progression**: The `chord.Chord` object is used to create chords from the progression.
3. **Bass Line Generation**: For each bar, the script selects the bass note of the current chord and appends it to the bass line stream.

This script generates a simple bass line by taking the bass note of each chord in the progression and placing it in the bass octave. You can further enhance this by adding rhythmic variations or more complex patterns.

### Evaluation of Assistant A and Assistant B:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Uses the `music21` library, which is appropriate for this task.
- Correctly defines the key and chord progression.
- Generates a bass line by selecting random notes from the chord, which is a valid but basic approach.
- Provides a complete and runnable example.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Does not use the `music21` library, which is a more suitable tool for this task.
- Defines custom classes for key and chord progression, which adds unnecessary complexity.
- The bass line generation logic is less clear and seems to hard-code specific notes for chords, which is not scalable or flexible.
- The example is less complete and does not produce a musically coherent bass line.

### Conclusion:
Assistant A's answer is more appropriate and effective for generating a bass line based on the given parameters. It uses the `music21` library, which is designed for such tasks, and provides a clear, concise, and runnable example.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
