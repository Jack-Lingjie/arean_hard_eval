### My Answer

To move your trading activities to a company and have the profits taxed as corporate income, you have several options. Here are some considerations:

1. **Type of Company**:
   - **Germany**: A common choice is a **GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung)**, which is a limited liability company. This structure provides limited liability protection and is suitable for trading activities.
   - **Other Countries**: You might consider setting up a company in a country with a more favorable tax regime. Common choices include:
     - **Ireland**: Known for its low corporate tax rate of 12.5%.
     - **Luxembourg**: Offers various tax incentives and a relatively low corporate tax rate.
     - **Netherlands**: Has favorable tax treaties and a competitive corporate tax rate.
     - **Cyprus**: Offers a low corporate tax rate of 12.5% and various tax incentives.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Germany**: The corporate tax rate for a GmbH is around 15%, plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the corporate tax, and trade tax, which varies by municipality. The effective tax rate can range between 30% and 33%.
   - **Other Countries**: When considering other countries, look at the corporate tax rate, any applicable surcharges, and the presence of double taxation agreements (DTAs) with Germany to avoid being taxed twice on the same income.

3. **Regulatory and Compliance Requirements**:
   - **Germany**: Setting up a GmbH involves certain administrative and compliance requirements, including maintaining proper accounting records and filing annual financial statements.
   - **Other Countries**: Each country has its own regulatory environment, so it's important to understand the local requirements for setting up and maintaining a company.

4. **Professional Advice**:
   - It is crucial to consult with a tax advisor or attorney who specializes in international tax law to ensure you are making the best decision for your specific situation. They can help you navigate the complexities of setting up a company and ensure compliance with all relevant regulations.

### Conclusion
While setting up a GmbH in Germany is a straightforward option, exploring other countries with more favorable tax regimes could be beneficial. However, the decision should be made after thorough research and professional consultation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and compliance requirements.
