To develop an efficient prime search algorithm in MATLAB, one of the most well-known and efficient methods is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This algorithm is particularly effective for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. Here is a MATLAB implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes:

```matlab
function primesList = primeSearch(n)
    % Input: n - the upper limit for searching primes
    % Output: primesList - a list of prime numbers up to n

    % Create a logical array and assume all numbers in array are prime
    isPrime = true(1, n);

    % We know 1 is not a prime number
    isPrime(1) = false;

    % Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
    for i = 2:sqrt(n)
        if isPrime(i)
            % Mark all multiples of i as non-prime
            isPrime(i^2:i:n) = false;
        end
    end

    % Extract the prime numbers from the logical array
    primesList = find(isPrime);
end
```

To use this function, simply call it with the desired upper limit:

```matlab
n = 100;
primesList = primeSearch(n);
disp(primesList);
```

This will display all prime numbers up to 100. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log log n) and is one of the most efficient methods for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The `primeSearch` function takes one input `n`, which is the upper limit for the prime search.
2. **Initialization**: A logical array `isPrime` is created, initially assuming all numbers are prime.
3. **Special Case**: The number 1 is set to `false` as it is not a prime number.
4. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: The algorithm iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each number `i` that is still marked as prime, it marks all multiples of `i` as non-prime.
5. **Extract Primes**: The function uses the `find` function to extract indices of the `isPrime` array that are still `true`, which correspond to prime numbers.

### Tips:
- **Optimization**: For very large values of `n`, consider using segmented sieves or parallel processing to further optimize the algorithm.
- **Memory Usage**: The Sieve of Eratosthenes can be memory-intensive for very large `n`. Ensure your system has sufficient memory or consider memory-efficient variations of the sieve.
