To create a Streamlit app that plays videos, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Streamlit**:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Create a Python file (e.g., `video_app.py`)** and add the following code:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st

   # Title of the app
   st.title("Video Player App")

   # Upload video file
   video_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a video", type=["mp4", "avi", "mov", "mkv"])

   # Play the uploaded video
   if video_file is not None:
       st.video(video_file)
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run video_app.py
   ```

This code creates a simple Streamlit app with a file uploader that accepts video files in mp4, avi, mov, and mkv formats. Once a video is uploaded, it will be played in the app using Streamlit's built-in video player.

### Explanation:
- **Streamlit Installation**: The first step is to install Streamlit using pip.
- **Creating the App**: The Python script sets up a basic Streamlit app with a title and a file uploader widget. The `st.video` function is used to play the uploaded video.
- **Running the App**: The `streamlit run` command starts the Streamlit server and opens the app in your default web browser.

This approach leverages Streamlit's built-in capabilities to handle video playback, making it simpler and more efficient than using external libraries like OpenCV.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The answer is mostly correct but uses OpenCV for video playback, which is more complex and less efficient than using Streamlit's built-in `st.video` function.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful but introduces unnecessary complexity by using OpenCV.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant but could be simplified.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is somewhat verbose due to the inclusion of OpenCV.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The answer is correct but focuses on embedding YouTube videos rather than playing uploaded video files.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful for embedding YouTube videos but does not address the user's request to play uploaded videos.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is less relevant to the user's specific request.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is concise but not entirely on point.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the user's request to play uploaded videos, despite being more complex than necessary. Assistant B's answer, while simpler, does not address the user's request to play uploaded videos.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
