To solve the problem of finding the expected number of rounds to end the game, we need to derive a recursive formula for \( E(N, M) \), where \( N \) is the number of unique numbers assigned to the player and \( M \) is the total number of unique numbers from 1 to \( T \).

### Derivation of the Recursive Formula

1. **Base Case**: If \( N = 0 \), the game has already ended, so \( E(0, M) = 0 \).

2. **Recursive Case**: If \( N > 0 \), we need to consider two scenarios:
   - A number assigned to the player is drawn.
   - A number not assigned to the player is drawn.

   The probability of drawing one of the player's numbers is \( \frac{N}{M} \), and the probability of drawing a number not assigned to the player is \( \frac{M-N}{M} \).

   - If one of the player's numbers is drawn, the player now has \( N-1 \) numbers left, and there are \( M-1 \) numbers remaining in total. The expected number of rounds in this case is \( E(N-1, M-1) \).
   - If none of the player's numbers are drawn, the player still has \( N \) numbers left, and there are \( M-1 \) numbers remaining in total. The expected number of rounds in this case is \( 1 + E(N, M-1) \), as we add 1 round for the current round.

Therefore, the recursive formula for \( E(N, M) \) can be written as:

\[ E(N, M) = 1 + \left( \frac{N}{M} \cdot E(N-1, M-1) + \frac{M-N}{M} \cdot E(N, M-1) \right) \]

### Summary
- **Base Case**: \( E(0, M) = 0 \)
- **Recursive Case**: \( E(N, M) = 1 + \left( \frac{N}{M} \cdot E(N-1, M-1) + \frac{M-N}{M} \cdot E(N, M-1) \right) \)

This formula accounts for the probabilities of drawing a player's number or not and adjusts the expected number of rounds accordingly.

### Evaluation of the Assistants' Answers

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Correctly identifies the base case \( E(0, M) = 0 \).
- Provides a recursive formula: \( E(N, M) = \frac{N}{M} \cdot E(N-1, M-1) + \frac{M-N}{M} \cdot (1 + E(N, M-1)) \).
- The formula is almost correct but misses the initial addition of 1 for the current round in the recursive case.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Correctly identifies the base case \( E(0, T) = 0 \).
- Provides a different recursive formula: \( E(N, T) = 1 + \frac{1}{T} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (i \cdot E(N-i, T-1)) \).
- This formula is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements. It introduces unnecessary complexity and does not correctly model the expected number of rounds based on the given probabilities.

### Final Verdict
Assistant A's answer is closer to the correct solution, though it misses the initial addition of 1 for the current round. Assistant B's answer is incorrect and overly complex.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
