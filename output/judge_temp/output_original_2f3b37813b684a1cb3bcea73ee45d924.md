To skip a function call if the same parameters were used before in Python, you can use memoization. Memoization is a technique where you store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Here is an example of how you can implement memoization using a decorator:

```python
def memoize(func):
    cache = {}

    def memoized_func(*args, **kwargs):
        key = (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))
        if key not in cache:
            cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return cache[key]

    return memoized_func

@memoize
def my_function(a, b):
    # Simulate an expensive computation
    return a + b

# Example usage
print(my_function(1, 2))  # This call will compute the result and store it in the cache
print(my_function(1, 2))  # This call will return the cached result
print(my_function(2, 3))  # This call will compute the result and store it in the cache
```

### Explanation:
1. **`memoize` function**: This is a decorator that takes a function `func` as an argument.
2. **`cache` dictionary**: Stores the results of function calls with their corresponding arguments.
3. **`memoized_func`**: The decorated function that checks the cache before calling the original function.
4. **`@memoize` decorator**: Applies the `memoize` decorator to the `my_function`.

### Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: Avoids redundant calculations by storing and reusing results.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and use with any function.

### Considerations:
- Use memoization when function calls are expensive or have side effects.
- Be mindful of cache size to avoid memory issues.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Provides a clear and correct implementation of memoization using a decorator.
- Includes both positional and keyword arguments in the cache key.
- Explanation is concise and relevant.
- Example usage is clear and demonstrates the concept effectively.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Provides a clear and correct implementation of memoization using a decorator.
- Only considers positional arguments in the cache key, which might be a limitation.
- Explanation is detailed and covers the concept well.
- Example usage is clear and demonstrates the concept effectively.

**Comparison:**
- Both answers are helpful, relevant, and concise.
- Assistant A's answer is slightly more robust as it handles both positional and keyword arguments in the cache key, making it more versatile.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
