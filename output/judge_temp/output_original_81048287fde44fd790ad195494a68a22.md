To restrict a PostgreSQL geometry column to only contain polygons, you can use the `CHECK` constraint with the `geometrytype` function from the PostGIS extension. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Ensure PostGIS Extension is Enabled**:
   First, make sure the PostGIS extension is enabled in your database. If it’s not already enabled, you can do so with the following command:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
   ```

2. **Create a Table with a Geometry Column and a CHECK Constraint**:
   When creating a new table, you can add a `CHECK` constraint to ensure that the geometry column only contains polygons:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE my_table (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255),
       geom GEOMETRY,
       CONSTRAINT enforce_geom_type CHECK (geometrytype(geom) = 'POLYGON' OR geom IS NULL)
   );
   ```
   In this example, the `geom` column is restricted to only contain polygons or NULL values. If you try to insert a non-polygon geometry, PostgreSQL will raise an error.

3. **Add a CHECK Constraint to an Existing Table**:
   If you already have a table with a geometry column and want to add the constraint, you can use the `ALTER TABLE` statement:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE my_table
   ADD CONSTRAINT enforce_geom_type CHECK (geometrytype(geom) = 'POLYGON' OR geom IS NULL);
   ```
   Replace `my_table` and `geom` with your table and column names, respectively.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your PostgreSQL geometry column only contains polygon geometries.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and Assistant B's Answers:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- **Correctness**: The answer is correct and provides a clear method to restrict the geometry column to polygons using a `CHECK` constraint.
- **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and directly addresses the user’s prompt.
- **Relevance**: The answer is relevant and focused on the task.
- **Conciseness**: The answer is concise and to the point.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- **Correctness**: The answer is correct and provides two methods: using a `CHECK` constraint and a trigger function.
- **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and provides additional information by offering an alternative method (trigger function).
- **Relevance**: The answer is relevant and covers the task comprehensively.
- **Conciseness**: The answer is slightly more verbose due to the inclusion of the trigger function method, but it is still clear and informative.

**Comparison and Verdict:**
- Both answers are correct and helpful. However, Assistant B provides an additional method (trigger function) which might be useful in certain scenarios, making the answer more comprehensive.
- Assistant A’s answer is more concise and directly addresses the prompt without additional methods.

Given the additional useful information provided by Assistant B, the final verdict is:
