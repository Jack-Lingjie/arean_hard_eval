### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Assistant A provides a detailed and structured learning path from foundational topics to advanced deep learning concepts.
2. **Logical Sequence**: The order of topics is logical, starting from basic mathematics and programming to more complex deep learning architectures and techniques.
3. **Practical Advice**: Emphasizes the importance of hands-on experience and practical projects, which is crucial for mastering deep learning.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Community Engagement**: Does not mention the importance of joining online communities or participating in competitions like Kaggle.
2. **No Mention of Continuous Learning**: Does not emphasize the need to stay updated with the latest research papers and developments in the field.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Assistant B also provides a detailed learning path, covering foundational topics to advanced deep learning concepts.
2. **Community Engagement**: Emphasizes the importance of joining online communities and participating in competitions.
3. **Continuous Learning**: Stresses the need to stay updated with research papers and attend conferences.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Repetition**: The answer becomes repetitive after a certain point, listing the same steps multiple times, which makes it unnecessarily long and confusing.
2. **Less Structured**: The structure is less clear due to the repetitive nature of the content, making it harder to follow.

### Comparison and Final Verdict

Both assistants provide a comprehensive and logical learning path for deep learning. However, Assistant B's answer, despite its repetition, includes important aspects like community engagement and continuous learning, which are crucial for staying updated in the fast-evolving field of deep learning. Assistant A's answer is more concise and structured but misses out on these aspects.

Given the importance of community engagement and continuous learning, Assistant B's answer is slightly better, despite the repetition issue.

**Final Verdict: [[B>A]]**
