To determine the change in total assets, we can use the basic accounting equation:

\[ \text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Stockholders' Equity} \]

Given:
- Total liabilities decreased by $25,000.
- Stockholders' equity increased by $5,000.

We need to find the net change in total assets. 

1. A decrease in liabilities means that the company has less debt, which effectively increases the assets by the same amount. So, a $25,000 decrease in liabilities increases assets by $25,000.
2. An increase in stockholders' equity means that the company has more equity, which also increases the assets by the same amount. So, a $5,000 increase in stockholders' equity increases assets by $5,000.

Adding these changes together:

\[ \text{Change in Assets} = \text{Decrease in Liabilities} + \text{Increase in Stockholders' Equity} \]
\[ \text{Change in Assets} = \$25,000 + \$5,000 \]
\[ \text{Change in Assets} = \$30,000 \]

Therefore, the total assets increased by $30,000.

The correct answer is:
$30,000 increase.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Assistant A stated "$20,000 decrease," which is incorrect. The calculation and direction of change are both wrong.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Assistant B provided a detailed explanation using the accounting equation and correctly calculated the change in total assets. The answer "$30,000 increase" is correct.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant B is significantly better because the answer is correct and well-explained, whereas Assistant A's answer is incorrect.

My final verdict is: [[B>>A]]
