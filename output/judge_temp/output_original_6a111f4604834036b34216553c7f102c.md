The most efficient way to uniformly sample a point inside a right-angle triangle is to use the following method:

1. Generate two random numbers, \( u \) and \( v \), uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
2. If \( u + v > 1 \), set \( u = 1 - u \) and \( v = 1 - v \). This step ensures that the sampled point lies within the triangle.
3. Scale the random numbers \( u \) and \( v \) by the lengths of the triangle's legs. Let \( A \) and \( B \) be the lengths of the legs of the right-angle triangle, with \( A \) being the length of the horizontal leg and \( B \) being the length of the vertical leg.
4. The sampled point \((x, y)\) inside the triangle can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   x = u \times A
   y = v \times B
   \]

This method ensures that the points are uniformly distributed within the triangle.

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: Generating two random numbers \( u \) and \( v \) ensures that we start with a uniform distribution in a unit square.
- **Step 2**: The condition \( u + v > 1 \) and the subsequent transformation \( u = 1 - u \) and \( v = 1 - v \) effectively maps the points from the upper triangle (where \( u + v > 1 \)) to the lower triangle (where \( u + v \leq 1 \)), ensuring uniform distribution within the right-angle triangle.
- **Step 3**: Scaling by the lengths of the legs \( A \) and \( B \) adjusts the points to fit the actual dimensions of the triangle.
- **Step 4**: The final coordinates \((x, y)\) are guaranteed to be uniformly distributed within the triangle.

This method is efficient and straightforward, leveraging simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks to achieve uniform sampling.
