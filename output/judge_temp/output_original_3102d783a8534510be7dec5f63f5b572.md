To use a package from the nixpkgs unstable channel with `nix-shell -p`, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Add the unstable channel**: First, ensure that you have the unstable channel added to your Nix channels. You can add it by running:
   ```bash
   nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable nixpkgs-unstable
   ```

2. **Update your channels**: Update your channels to make sure you have the latest package information:
   ```bash
   nix-channel --update
   ```

3. **Use nix-shell with the unstable channel**: Now, you can use `nix-shell` with the `-I` flag to specify the unstable channel when running the command. For example, if you want to use the `hello` package from the unstable channel, you would run:
   ```bash
   nix-shell -I nixpkgs=nixpkgs-unstable -p hello
   ```

This will start a new shell with the `hello` package from the nixpkgs unstable channel available for use.

Keep in mind that using packages from the unstable channel may have potential issues or bugs, as they are not as thoroughly tested as the stable channel packages.
