To calculate the series of an exponential function, we can use the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function \( e^x \). The Taylor series expansion of \( e^x \) is given by:

\[ e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots + \frac{x^n}{n!} \]

Here's a Python function to calculate the series of the exponential function up to a given number of terms:

```python
import math

def exponential_series(x, n_terms):
    result = 0
    for n in range(n_terms):
        term = (x ** n) / math.factorial(n)
        result += term
    return result

# Example usage:
x = 2
n_terms = 10
result = exponential_series(x, n_terms)
print(f"The exponential series of e^{x} up to {n_terms} terms is: {result}")
```

This function takes two arguments: `x` (the exponent) and `n_terms` (the number of terms to calculate in the series). It calculates the sum of the series up to the specified number of terms and returns the result.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and Assistant B's Answers

**Assistant A's Answer:**

1. **Correctness**: The answer correctly implements the Taylor series expansion for \( e^x \).
2. **Helpfulness**: The function is well-explained and includes an example usage.
3. **Relevance**: The response is directly relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The explanation and code are concise and to the point.

**Assistant B's Answer:**

1. **Correctness**: The answer does not correctly address the prompt. It calculates a series of powers of the base, not the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function.
2. **Helpfulness**: The function provided does not solve the problem as intended by the prompt.
3. **Relevance**: The response is not relevant to the prompt, as it does not calculate the Taylor series for \( e^x \).
4. **Conciseness**: The explanation is clear but not relevant to the task.

**Final Verdict:**

Assistant A's answer is significantly better because it correctly implements the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, which is what the prompt asked for. Assistant B's answer, while clear, does not address the prompt correctly.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
