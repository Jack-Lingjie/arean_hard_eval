To write a program in Python to calculate a flight path, you can use the Haversine formula to determine the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth's surface. Here is a step-by-step guide to create a simple program that calculates the flight path between two coordinates:

1. **Import the required libraries:**

```python
import math
```

2. **Define the Haversine function:**

```python
def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    # Convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians
    lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 = map(math.radians, [lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2])

    # Haversine formula
    dlat = lat2 - lat1
    dlon = lon2 - lon1
    a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon/2)**2
    c = 2 * math.asin(math.sqrt(a))

    # Earth's radius in kilometers (mean radius = 6,371km)
    R = 6371

    # Calculate the distance
    distance = R * c

    return distance
```

3. **Define the main function to get user input and calculate the flight path:**

```python
def main():
    # Get user input for coordinates
    lat1 = float(input("Enter the latitude of the first location (in decimal degrees): "))
    lon1 = float(input("Enter the longitude of the first location (in decimal degrees): "))
    lat2 = float(input("Enter the latitude of the second location (in decimal degrees): "))
    lon2 = float(input("Enter the longitude of the second location (in decimal degrees): "))

    # Calculate the flight path using the Haversine function
    distance = haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)

    # Print the result
    print(f"The flight path between the two locations is approximately {distance:.2f} kilometers.")
```

4. **Call the main function:**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here is the complete program:

```python
import math

def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 = map(math.radians, [lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2])
    dlat = lat2 - lat1
    dlon = lon2 - lon1
    a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon/2)**2
    c = 2 * math.asin(math.sqrt(a))
    R = 6371
    distance = R * c
    return distance

def main():
    lat1 = float(input("Enter the latitude of the first location (in decimal degrees): "))
    lon1 = float(input("Enter the longitude of the first location (in decimal degrees): "))
    lat2 = float(input("Enter the latitude of the second location (in decimal degrees): "))
    lon2 = float(input("Enter the longitude of the second location (in decimal degrees): "))
    distance = haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
    print(f"The flight path between the two locations is approximately {distance:.2f} kilometers.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program calculates the flight path (great-circle distance) between two coordinates on Earth's surface. Note that this is a simplified model and does not account for factors like altitude, wind, and flight restrictions.
