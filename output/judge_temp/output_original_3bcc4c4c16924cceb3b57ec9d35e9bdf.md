To delete a folder from a connected filesystem in a Synapse notebook, you can use Python's `shutil` library. Here is a code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:

```python
import shutil
import os

# Replace 'your_folder_path' with the path to the folder you want to delete
folder_path = 'your_folder_path'

# Check if the folder exists
if os.path.exists(folder_path):
    try:
        # Delete the folder and its contents
        shutil.rmtree(folder_path)
        print(f"Folder '{folder_path}' has been deleted.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Permission denied to delete folder '{folder_path}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Folder '{folder_path}' does not exist.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Libraries**: The code imports the `shutil` and `os` libraries. `shutil` is used for high-level file operations, and `os` is used for interacting with the operating system.
2. **Specifying the Folder Path**: Replace `'your_folder_path'` with the actual path to the folder you want to delete.
3. **Checking Folder Existence**: The code checks if the specified folder exists.
4. **Deleting the Folder**: If the folder exists, it attempts to delete it using `shutil.rmtree()`, which removes the folder and all its contents.
5. **Handling Exceptions**: The code catches `PermissionError` if there are permission issues and any other exceptions that might occur during the deletion process.

This code ensures that the folder is deleted only if it exists and handles potential errors gracefully.

### Evaluation of Assistant A and Assistant B:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Provides a clear and concise code snippet.
- Includes basic error handling by checking if the folder exists.
- Does not handle specific exceptions like `PermissionError`.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Provides a more detailed explanation and includes prerequisites.
- Handles specific exceptions like `PermissionError`.
- Mentions the use of `os.rmdir()` for empty directories, but does not use it in the code, which could be confusing.
- The explanation is more verbose, which might be helpful for beginners but could be seen as excessive for experienced users.

**Comparison:**
- Both answers are helpful and relevant, but Assistant B's answer is more comprehensive and handles exceptions better.
- Assistant A's answer is more concise but lacks specific exception handling.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant B's answer is slightly better due to its comprehensive explanation and better error handling.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
