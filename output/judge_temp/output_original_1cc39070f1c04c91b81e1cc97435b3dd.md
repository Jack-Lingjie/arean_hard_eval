To address the user's prompt regarding the `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException: Task was cancelled` error, here is a comprehensive response:

**Understanding the Error:**

The `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException` is thrown when a task that was submitted to an executor service is cancelled before it completes. This can happen for various reasons, such as explicit cancellation by calling `Future.cancel()`, or the executor service being shut down.

**Stacktrace Breakdown:**

1. **`X.0i9.A02(Unknown Source:32)`**: The error originates in the `A02` method of the `X.0i9` class.
2. **`X.0i9.get(Unknown Source:47)`**: The error propagates to the `get` method of the `X.0i9` class.
3. **`X.0lz.run(Unknown Source:4)`**: The task is executed by the `X.0lz` class.
4. **`X.0m4.run(Unknown Source:2)`**: The task is managed by the `X.0m4` class.
5. **`java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)`**: The thread pool executor from the Java standard library is running the task.
6. **`java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:644)`**: The worker thread is executing the task.
7. **`java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1012)`**: The task is running on a standard Java thread.

**Steps to Resolve the Error:**

1. **Identify the Cause of Cancellation:**
   - Check your code for any calls to `Future.cancel()` or `ExecutorService.shutdownNow()`.
   - Ensure that tasks are not being cancelled unintentionally.

2. **Handle the Cancellation Gracefully:**
   - Use a try-catch block to handle the `CancellationException`:

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw CancellationException
   } catch (CancellationException e) {
       // Handle the exception, e.g., log the error or perform cleanup tasks
   }
   ```

3. **Check for Interrupted Tasks:**
   - Ensure that tasks check for interruptions using `Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()` and handle them appropriately.

4. **Review Thread Pool Configuration:**
   - Verify that your thread pool is configured correctly and is not shutting down prematurely.

5. **Debug the Code:**
   - Use a debugger to step through the code and identify where the task is being cancelled.

**Example Use Case:**

Here is an example demonstrating how to handle task cancellation using a `Future` object:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class TaskExecutor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a task
        Callable<String> task = () -> {
            // Task execution code
            return "Task result";
        };

        // Submit the task to the thread pool
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);

        try {
            // Wait for the task to complete
            String result = future.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | TimeoutException e) {
            // Handle task cancellation or timeout
            System.out.println("Task cancelled or timed out");
        } catch (CancellationException e) {
            // Handle the specific case of task cancellation
            System.out.println("Task was cancelled");
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TaskExecutor` class demonstrates how to handle task cancellation and other potential exceptions when using a `Future` object.
