**Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:**

Assistant A's answer is well-structured and provides a detailed workout plan that meets the user's requirements. The total distance is correctly calculated, and the workout includes a warm-up, pre-set, main set, pull set, and cool-down, which are all appropriate for an advanced swimmer. The instructions are clear and concise, making it easy for the user to follow.

**Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:**

Assistant B's answer is overly verbose and repetitive, with many sections repeated multiple times. While it does provide a main set of 15x100 at 1:30 and includes some useful tips and additional information, it lacks the detailed structure of a complete workout plan. The total distance is not clearly calculated, and the answer includes a lot of extraneous information that is not directly relevant to the user's request.

**Final Verdict:**

Assistant A's answer is significantly better because it provides a clear, concise, and well-structured workout plan that meets the user's requirements without unnecessary repetition or extraneous information.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
