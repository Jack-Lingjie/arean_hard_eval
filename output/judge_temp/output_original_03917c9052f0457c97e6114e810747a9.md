To generate SystemVerilog constraints ensuring that the number of transitions from the previous output is equal to 5 in a 32-bit number, you can use the following approach:

1. Define a class with random variables for the current and previous outputs.
2. Implement a function to count the number of bit transitions between the two 32-bit numbers.
3. Create a constraint to ensure the number of transitions is exactly 5.

Here is a sample implementation:

```systemverilog
class TransitionConstraint;
  rand bit [31:0] current_output;
  rand bit [31:0] previous_output;

  // Function to count the number of transitions between two 32-bit numbers
  function int count_transitions(bit [31:0] a, bit [31:0] b);
    int transitions = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) begin
      if (a[i] !== b[i]) transitions++;
    end
    return transitions;
  endfunction

  // Constraint to ensure 5 transitions between previous_output and current_output
  constraint five_transitions {
    count_transitions(previous_output, current_output) == 5;
  }
endclass

module tb;
  TransitionConstraint tc;

  initial begin
    tc = new();
    if (tc.randomize()) begin
      $display("Previous Output: %h", tc.previous_output);
      $display("Current Output: %h", tc.current_output);
    end else begin
      $display("Randomization failed");
    end
  end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Definition**: The `TransitionConstraint` class contains two 32-bit random variables, `current_output` and `previous_output`.
2. **Transition Counting Function**: The `count_transitions` function iterates through each bit of the two 32-bit numbers and counts the number of bit positions where the bits differ.
3. **Constraint**: The `five_transitions` constraint ensures that the number of transitions between `previous_output` and `current_output` is exactly 5.
4. **Testbench**: The testbench instantiates the `TransitionConstraint` class, randomizes the values, and displays the results.

This approach ensures that the number of transitions between the previous and current 32-bit outputs is exactly 5.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and Assistant B's Answers:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Correctly defines a class with random variables for the current and previous outputs.
- Implements a function to count the number of transitions.
- Provides a constraint to ensure exactly 5 transitions.
- Includes a testbench to demonstrate the usage.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Uses `unique` and `count` constraints, which are not appropriate for counting bit transitions between two 32-bit numbers.
- The provided example and constraints do not correctly address the problem of counting bit transitions.
- The explanation and example are not relevant to the user's prompt.

**Conclusion:**
Assistant A's answer is more accurate, relevant, and helpful in addressing the user's prompt. It correctly implements the required functionality and provides a clear example.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
