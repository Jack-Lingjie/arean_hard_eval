To develop an algorithm to classify dataset types between master-data and transactional, I would follow these steps:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Understand the dataset structure, columns, and relationships.
   - Identify key features that differentiate master-data from transactional data.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Number of Unique Values**: Master-data often has more unique values in key columns.
   - **Column Data Types**: Master-data may have more categorical columns, while transactional data may have more numerical columns (e.g., dates, amounts).
   - **Relationships Between Columns**: Master-data typically has more relationships between columns.
   - **Temporal Patterns**: Transactional data usually has a time component (e.g., date, time).

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose a suitable machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines).

4. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model on the training set using the extracted features.
   - Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the model to classify new datasets.

7. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Monitor the model's performance and update it with new data.
   - Explore new features and techniques to improve classification performance.

### Example Calculations

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Data Profiling
record_count = df.shape[0]
column_count = df.shape[1]

# Feature Engineering
average_record_age = (df['date'].max() - df['date'].min()).days
record_frequency = df['date'].dt.day.unique().size
data_volume = df.memory_usage().sum()

# Machine Learning
X = df.drop('dataset_type', axis=1)
y = df['dataset_type']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}")
print(f"F1-score: {f1:.3f}")
```

### Example Use Cases

- **Master-Data Classification**: Classify datasets containing master data, such as customer information or product catalogs.
- **Transactional Data Classification**: Classify datasets containing transactional data, such as sales records or financial transactions.

### Advice

- **Data Quality**: Ensure the dataset is clean and free of errors.
- **Feature Engineering**: Carefully select relevant features to improve accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the model's performance.
