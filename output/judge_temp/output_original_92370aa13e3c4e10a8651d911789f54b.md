To evaluate the effects on the plant nursery's accounting equation, we need to consider the two transactions provided:

1. Four shareholders contributed $60,000 ($15,000 each) in exchange for the plant nursery's common stock.
2. The plant nursery purchases inventory for $10,000 and paid cash for the invoice.

The accounting equation is: **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

**Transaction 1: Shareholder Contribution**
- Assets (Cash) increase by $60,000.
- Equity (Common Stock) increases by $60,000.

**Transaction 2: Purchase of Inventory**
- Assets (Cash) decrease by $10,000.
- Assets (Inventory) increase by $10,000.

After both transactions, the accounting equation is:

**Assets (Cash + Inventory) = Liabilities + Equity (Common Stock)**
- Cash: $60,000 (initial) - $10,000 (purchase) = $50,000
- Inventory: $10,000
- Liabilities: $0
- Equity: $60,000

So, the final accounting equation is:

**Assets (Cash + Inventory) = Liabilities + Equity**
$50,000 (Cash) + $10,000 (Inventory) = $0 + $60,000

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Correctly identifies the accounting equation.
- Accurately describes the effects of both transactions.
- Provides the final accounting equation correctly.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Correctly identifies the accounting equation.
- Accurately describes the effects of both transactions.
- Provides the final accounting equation but does not break down the components of assets (Cash and Inventory) as clearly as Assistant A.

Both assistants provided accurate and relevant information. However, Assistant A's answer is slightly more detailed in breaking down the components of the assets, which makes it clearer and more helpful.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
