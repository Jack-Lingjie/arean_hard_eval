To scrape the website https://leftwinglock.com/line-combinations/anaheim-ducks/?team=anaheim-ducks&strength=EV&gametype=GD, you can use Python with libraries like Requests and Beautiful Soup. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install the necessary libraries**:
   If you haven't already, install the Requests and Beautiful Soup libraries using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install requests
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Import the libraries and set the URL**:
   In your Python script, import the necessary libraries and set the URL you want to scrape:
   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

   url = "https://leftwinglock.com/line-combinations/anaheim-ducks/?team=anaheim-ducks&strength=EV&gametype=GD"
   ```

3. **Send an HTTP request and parse the HTML content**:
   ```python
   response = requests.get(url)
   soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
   ```

4. **Extract the data you need**:
   Inspect the website's HTML source code to identify the tags and attributes that contain the data you want to extract. For example, if you want to extract the line combinations, you can find them in a table with the class "tbl-lines". You can then loop through the table rows and extract the data from each cell.

   ```python
   line_combinations = []

   table = soup.find("table", class_="tbl-lines")
   rows = table.find_all("tr")

   for row in rows[1:]:  # Skip the header row
       cells = row.find_all("td")
       if len(cells) == 6:  # Ensure there are 6 cells in the row
           line = {
               "line_number": cells[0].text.strip(),
               "left_wing": cells[1].text.strip(),
               "center": cells[2].text.strip(),
               "right_wing": cells[3].text.strip(),
               "time_on_ice": cells[4].text.strip(),
               "games_played": cells[5].text.strip(),
           }
           line_combinations.append(line)

   print(line_combinations)
   ```

5. **Save the extracted data**:
   You can save the extracted data in any format you prefer, such as CSV, JSON, or a database. For example, to save the data as a CSV file:

   ```python
   import csv

   with open("line_combinations.csv", "w", newline="") as csvfile:
       fieldnames = ["line_number", "left_wing", "center", "right_wing", "time_on_ice", "games_played"]
       writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

       writer.writeheader()
       for line in line_combinations:
           writer.writerow(line)
   ```

This script will scrape the line combinations from the given URL and save them as a CSV file. You can modify the script to extract other data from the website as needed.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Respect the website's terms of service**: Always check the website's terms of service to ensure that you are allowed to scrape the data.
- **Handle potential changes in the website's structure**: Websites can change their structure, so you may need to update your scraping script accordingly.
- **Consider using more advanced tools**: For more complex scraping tasks, you might want to consider using tools like Scrapy or Selenium.
