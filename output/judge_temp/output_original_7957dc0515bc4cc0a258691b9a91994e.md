Here is my cleaned-up version of the provided code:

```python
import random
from enum import Enum

class RollResult(Enum):
    FAIL = "FAIL"
    PARTIAL = "PARTIAL"
    SUCCESS = "SUCCESS"
    CRITICAL = "CRITICAL"

def roll(n):
    """Roll nD6 and return a list of rolls."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n)]

def determine_result(rolls):
    """Determine the result based on the rolls."""
    if rolls.count(6) >= 3:
        return RollResult.CRITICAL
    if 6 in rolls:
        return RollResult.SUCCESS
    if rolls.count(5) >= 3:
        return RollResult.SUCCESS
    if 5 in rolls:
        return RollResult.PARTIAL
    if 4 in rolls:
        return RollResult.PARTIAL
    return RollResult.FAIL

def make_roll(skill=0, stat=0, difficulty=0, help=False, bargain=False):
    """Make a roll with the given skill, stat, and difficulty."""
    n = skill + stat + difficulty + (1 if help else 0) + (1 if bargain else 0)
    if n < 1:
        return roll(2)
    return roll(n)

# Example usage
rolls = make_roll(2, 2, -2, True, False)
result = determine_result(rolls)
print("Rolls:", rolls)
print("Result:", result)

# Roll 3D6 10,000 times and estimate the probability of each result
results = [determine_result(make_roll(2, 2, -2, True, False)) for _ in range(10000)]

print("FAIL:", results.count(RollResult.FAIL) / len(results))
print("PARTIAL:", results.count(RollResult.PARTIAL) / len(results))
print("SUCCESS:", results.count(RollResult.SUCCESS) / len(results))
print("CRITICAL:", results.count(RollResult.CRITICAL) / len(results))
```

Changes made:
1. Replaced individual classes for each roll result with a single `RollResult` enum.
2. Removed the unused `import re` statement.
3. Removed the duplicate `make_roll` function.
4. Improved comments for better readability.
5. Ensured consistent formatting and indentation.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Assistant A's Answer:
1. Replaced individual classes with a single `RollResult` class containing constants.
2. Removed the unused `make_roll` function.
3. Updated comments and removed the unused `import re` statement.

### Assistant B's Answer:
1. Used Python's built-in `Enum` class for roll results.
2. Simplified the `determine_result` function.
3. Removed the duplicate `make_roll` function.
4. Improved code formatting and added comments.

### Evaluation:
1. **Correctness**: Both assistants provided correct and functional code. However, Assistant B's use of the `Enum` class is more idiomatic and aligns with best practices in Python.
2. **Helpfulness**: Both answers are helpful, but Assistant B's answer is slightly more detailed in explaining the changes.
3. **Relevance**: Both answers are relevant and address the prompt effectively.
4. **Conciseness**: Both answers are concise, but Assistant B's answer is slightly more structured with clear sections.
5. **Creativity and Novelty**: Assistant B's use of the `Enum` class is a more creative and modern approach.

### Verdict:
Assistant B's answer is slightly better due to the use of the `Enum` class and the structured explanation of changes.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
