To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) be the length of each Plan A workout in hours, and \( y \) be the length of each Plan B workout in hours.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. On Monday, 9 clients did Plan A and 7 clients did Plan B, totaling 12 hours of training.
2. On Tuesday, 3 clients did Plan A and 5 clients did Plan B, totaling 6 hours of training.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ 9x + 7y = 12 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]
\[ 3x + 5y = 6 \quad \text{(Equation 2)} \]

To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method. First, we will eliminate \( x \) by making the coefficients of \( x \) in both equations the same.

Multiply Equation 2 by 3:

\[ 9x + 15y = 18 \quad \text{(Equation 3)} \]

Now subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:

\[ (9x + 15y) - (9x + 7y) = 18 - 12 \]
\[ 8y = 6 \]
\[ y = \frac{6}{8} \]
\[ y = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now that we have \( y \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \( x \). Let's use Equation 1:

\[ 9x + 7\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = 12 \]
\[ 9x + \frac{21}{4} = 12 \]
\[ 9x = 12 - \frac{21}{4} \]
\[ 9x = \frac{48}{4} - \frac{21}{4} \]
\[ 9x = \frac{27}{4} \]
\[ x = \frac{27}{4} \div 9 \]
\[ x = \frac{27}{4} \times \frac{1}{9} \]
\[ x = \frac{27}{36} \]
\[ x = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, the length of each Plan A workout is \( \frac{3}{4} \) hour, and the length of each Plan B workout is also \( \frac{3}{4} \) hour.

### Final Answer:
- Length of each Plan A workout: \( \frac{3}{4} \) hour
- Length of each Plan B workout: \( \frac{3}{4} \) hour
