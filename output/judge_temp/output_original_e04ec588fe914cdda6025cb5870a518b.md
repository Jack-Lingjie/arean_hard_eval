To handle a support case effectively, I would follow these steps:

1. **Gather Initial Information:**
   - Request the user to provide detailed information about the issue, including error messages, steps to reproduce the problem, and any recent changes to the system.

2. **Query Experts:**
   - **support-history-expert:** Ask if there have been similar cases in the past and what the resolutions were.
   - **support-code-expert:** Inquire about potential issues in the source code that could cause the reported problem.
   - **support-subject-expert:** Seek insights into the professional subject matter and interrelationships that might be relevant to the issue.
   - **support-workflow-expert:** Ask about the typical workflow and routing for handling such support cases.
   - **support-staff-expert:** Determine which team members are responsible for addressing this type of issue.

3. **Analyze Expert Responses:**
   - Compile and review the responses from all experts to identify common themes or solutions.

4. **Formulate a Plan:**
   - Based on the expert insights, develop a step-by-step plan to resolve the issue.

5. **Implement and Communicate:**
   - Execute the plan and keep the user informed about the progress and any actions they need to take.

6. **Follow-Up:**

**Evaluation of Assistant A and B:**

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Assistant A's response is very brief and only asks for the support case details without outlining any specific steps or queries to the experts.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Assistant B provides a detailed plan, including specific steps to query each expert and a structured approach to handle the support case. However, the response is excessively repetitive, which detracts from its conciseness and clarity.

**Comparison:**
- **Helpfulness:** Assistant B is more helpful as it provides a clear plan and specific queries for each expert.
- **Relevance:** Both responses are relevant, but Assistant B's detailed plan is more aligned with the prompt.
- **Conciseness:** Assistant A is more concise but lacks detail. Assistant B is detailed but overly repetitive.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant B's response, despite its repetitiveness, is more comprehensive and provides a clear plan for handling the support case. Therefore, it is slightly better.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
