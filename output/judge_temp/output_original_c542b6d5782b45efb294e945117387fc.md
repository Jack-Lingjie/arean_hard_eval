Here is my own answer to the prompt:

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600

# Colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

# Create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("DVD Screensaver")

# Load the DVD logo
dvd_logo = pygame.image.load("dvd_logo.png")
logo_rect = dvd_logo.get_rect()

# Set the initial position and speed
logo_rect.x = random.randint(0, WIDTH - logo_rect.width)
logo_rect.y = random.randint(0, HEIGHT - logo_rect.height)
speed_x = random.choice([-3, 3])
speed_y = random.choice([-3, 3])

# Set up the font
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)

# Initialize the point tally
points = 0

# Main loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Move the logo
    logo_rect.x += speed_x
    logo_rect.y += speed_y

    # Check for collisions with the screen edges
    if logo_rect.left <= 0 or logo_rect.right >= WIDTH:
        speed_x = -speed_x
        if logo_rect.left <= 0:
            logo_rect.left = 0
        else:
            logo_rect.right = WIDTH

    if logo_rect.top <= 0 or logo_rect.bottom >= HEIGHT:
        speed_y = -speed_y
        if logo_rect.top <= 0:
            logo_rect.top = 0
        else:
            logo_rect.bottom = HEIGHT

    # Check for corner collisions and update the point tally
    if (logo_rect.left == 0 or logo_rect.right == WIDTH) and (logo_rect.top == 0 or logo_rect.bottom == HEIGHT):
        points += 1

    # Draw everything
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    screen.blit(dvd_logo, logo_rect)

    # Draw the point tally
    point_text = font.render(f"Points: {points}", True, WHITE)
    screen.blit(point_text, (10, 10))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()
    pygame.time.delay(10)

# Quit Pygame
pygame.quit()
```

Before running the script, make sure you have the Pygame library installed:

```
pip install pygame
```

Also, save a DVD logo image as "dvd_logo.png" in the same directory as the script. The script will create a window with the DVD logo bouncing around, and it will display the point tally in the top-left corner of the screen.

**Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:**

1. **Correctness**: The script provided by Assistant A is correct and functional. It initializes Pygame, sets up the screen, loads the DVD logo, and handles the bouncing logic and point tally correctly.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful as it provides a complete script and instructions on how to run it.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is concise and to the point.
5. **Creativity and Novelty**: The answer is straightforward and does not include any additional creative elements.

**Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:**

1. **Correctness**: The script provided by Assistant B is also correct and functional. It initializes Pygame, sets up the screen, and handles the bouncing logic and point tally correctly. However, it uses a simple red square instead of loading an image for the DVD logo.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful as it provides a complete script and instructions on how to run it. However, it does not use an actual DVD logo image, which might be less visually appealing.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is concise and to the point.
5. **Creativity and Novelty**: The answer is straightforward but uses a simple red square instead of an actual DVD logo image, which is less creative.

**Final Verdict:**

Both answers are correct and functional, but Assistant A's answer is slightly better because it uses an actual DVD logo image, which is more in line with the prompt.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
