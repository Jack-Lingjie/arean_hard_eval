To help the user program a tool in Python that loads a webpage's source code and extracts a meta token with a property called "og:image", here is a comprehensive answer:

### Required Libraries
You will need the `requests` library to fetch the webpage source code and `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library to parse the HTML and extract the "og:image" meta token.

### Installation
First, install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Code
Here is a Python script that accomplishes the task:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def extract_og_image(url):
    """
    Extracts the 'og:image' meta token from a webpage.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL of the webpage.

    Returns:
        str: The URL of the 'og:image' content, or None if not found.
    """
    try:
        # Fetch the webpage content
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an HTTPError for bad responses

        # Parse the HTML content
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

        # Find the "og:image" meta tag
        og_image_tag = soup.find("meta", property="og:image")

        # Extract the content attribute value
        if og_image_tag:
            return og_image_tag.get("content")
        else:
            print("Error: The 'og:image' meta tag was not found.")
            return None
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error: Unable to fetch the webpage. Exception: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = "https://example.com"  # Replace with the desired URL
    og_image_url = extract_og_image(url)
    if og_image_url:
        print(f"The 'og:image' URL is: {og_image_url}")
```

### Explanation
1. **Send an HTTP GET Request**: Use `requests.get()` to fetch the webpage's source code.
2. **Error Handling**: Use `response.raise_for_status()` to handle HTTP errors.
3. **Parse HTML Content**: Utilize `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content.
4. **Find the Meta Tag**: Use `soup.find()` to locate the meta tag with the "og:image" property.
5. **Return the Meta Token**: If the meta tag is found, return its content.

### Example Use Case
Replace `"https://example.com"` with the URL of the webpage you want to extract the meta token from. The script will print the extracted meta token value.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- **Correctness**: The code provided is correct and functional.
- **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and provides a clear solution to the user's request.
- **Relevance**: The response is relevant and directly addresses the user's prompt.
- **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is included for HTTP status codes.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- **Correctness**: The code provided is correct and functional.
- **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and provides a clear solution to the user's request.
- **Relevance**: The response is relevant and directly addresses the user's prompt.
- **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is included for HTTP status codes.

Both answers are very similar in terms of correctness, helpfulness, relevance, and conciseness. They both provide a clear and functional solution to the user's request. However, Assistant A's answer includes a slightly more detailed explanation of the steps involved in the code, which might be more helpful for a user who is less familiar with Python.

### Final Verdict
My final verdict is tie: [[A=B]]
