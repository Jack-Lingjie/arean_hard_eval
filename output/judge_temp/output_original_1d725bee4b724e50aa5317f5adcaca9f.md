To determine how long it would take to hit 40,000 steps if you walk 1,700 steps every 15 minutes, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of steps you take per minute:
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ steps}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = 113.33 \text{ steps per minute} \]

2. Calculate the total time in minutes to reach 40,000 steps:
\[ \frac{40000 \text{ steps}}{113.33 \text{ steps per minute}} \approx 353.03 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours and minutes:
\[ 353.03 \text{ minutes} \approx 5 \text{ hours and } 53 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take approximately 5 hours and 53 minutes to hit 40,000 steps at your current pace.
