To reduce the loss in your neural network training with nanoGPT, consider the following steps:

1. **Learning Rate Adjustment**:
   - Experiment with different learning rates. Start with a higher learning rate and gradually decrease it using learning rate scheduling techniques like cosine annealing or step decay.

2. **Optimizer Choice**:
   - Try different optimizers such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad. Each optimizer has its own advantages and might help in achieving a lower loss.

3. **Batch Size and Block Size**:
   - Given your GPU memory constraint (12GB), you need to balance batch size and block size. While larger batch sizes can stabilize training, they also require more memory. Since you achieved a lower loss with a batch size of 12 and block size of 1024, consider experimenting with intermediate values to find an optimal balance.

4. **Model Architecture**:
   - Experiment with different architectures. You can increase the number of layers, change the number of hidden units, or try different activation functions. Ensure that the model complexity is manageable within your GPU memory limits.

5. **Regularization Techniques**:
   - Apply regularization methods like dropout, weight decay, and early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

6. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Augment your training data to increase its diversity. Techniques like synonym replacement, back-translation, or random transformations can help the model learn more robust representations.

7. **Preprocessing**:
   - Improve your data preprocessing pipeline. Ensure that tokenization is optimal and consider techniques like stemming or lemmatization to reduce vocabulary size and improve data quality.

8. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Utilize pre-trained models and fine-tune them on your specific task. This can significantly reduce training time and improve performance.

9. **Gradient Clipping**:
   - Implement gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients, which can cause instability during training.

10. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - Perform systematic hyperparameter tuning using methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

11. **Evaluation Metrics**:
    - Monitor other evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, or BLEU score to ensure that a lower loss translates to better performance on your specific task.

12. **Memory Management**:
    - Ensure that your batch size and model architecture do not exceed the 12GB GPU memory limit. Use memory-efficient techniques and tools to monitor and manage GPU memory usage.

By systematically experimenting with these strategies, you can potentially reduce the loss and improve the performance of your neural network.
