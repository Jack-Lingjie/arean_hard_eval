To count distinct values in a column given a constraint from another column using the `OVER` clause in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), you can use the following query structure:

```sql
SELECT
    ColumnToApplyConstraint,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ColumnToCountDistinctValues) OVER (PARTITION BY ColumnToApplyConstraint) AS DistinctCount
FROM
    YourTableName
WHERE
    ConstraintColumn = 'YourConstraintValue'
```

Replace `YourTableName`, `ColumnToApplyConstraint`, `ColumnToCountDistinctValues`, `ConstraintColumn`, and `YourConstraintValue` with the appropriate values for your specific use case.

Here's an example using a hypothetical table called `Orders`:

```sql
SELECT
    CustomerID,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ProductID) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS DistinctProductCount
FROM
    Orders
WHERE
    OrderStatus = 'Completed'
```

In this example, we're counting the distinct `ProductID` values for each `CustomerID`, but only considering rows where the `OrderStatus` is 'Completed'.

### Explanation:
- **ColumnToApplyConstraint**: The column that defines the constraint.
- **ColumnToCountDistinctValues**: The column for which you want to count distinct values.
- **COUNT(DISTINCT ColumnToCountDistinctValues) OVER (PARTITION BY ColumnToApplyConstraint)**:
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT ColumnToCountDistinctValues)`: Counts the distinct values in the specified column.
  - `OVER (PARTITION BY ColumnToApplyConstraint)`: Groups the result by the values in the constraint column.
- **WHERE ConstraintColumn = 'YourConstraintValue'**: Applies the constraint to filter the rows before counting distinct values.

This approach ensures that the distinct count is calculated only for the rows that meet the specified constraint.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
Assistant A provides a clear and correct SQL query structure and example. The explanation is concise and relevant, making it easy to understand how to apply the `OVER` clause with a constraint.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
Assistant B also provides a correct SQL query structure and example. However, the example query does not include a `WHERE` clause to apply the constraint, which is a crucial part of the user's request. This omission makes the answer less accurate and potentially misleading.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A's answer is more accurate and complete because it includes the necessary `WHERE` clause to apply the constraint, which is essential for the user's requirement.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
