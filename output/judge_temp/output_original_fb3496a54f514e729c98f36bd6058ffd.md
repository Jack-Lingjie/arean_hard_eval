Here is an ACL config for Tailscale that includes the three groups: `nill`, `family`, and `servers`, with the specified access rules:

```json
{
  "acls": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:nill"],
      "dst": ["*:*"]
    },
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:family"],
      "dst": ["*:*"],
      "users": ["*"],
      "ports": ["tailscale:exit-node"]
    },
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:servers"],
      "dst": ["*:*"],
      "ports": ["22/tcp", "80/tcp", "443/tcp"]
    },
    {
      "action": "drop",
      "src": ["group:servers"],
      "dst": ["*:*"],
      "ports": ["!22/tcp", "!80/tcp", "!443/tcp"]
    }
  ],
  "groups": {
    "nill": ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"],
    "family": ["user3@example.com", "user4@example.com"],
    "servers": ["user5@example.com", "user6@example.com"]
  },
  "hosts": {}
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`nill` Group**: Has access to all servers on all ports.
- **`family` Group**: Can use any server as an exit node but does not have access to services on network servers.
- **`servers` Group**: Has access to ports 22/tcp, 80/tcp, and 443/tcp on all servers. All other ports and protocols are denied.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and B's Answers:

**Assistant A:**
- Correctly defines the groups and their access rules.
- Uses JSON format, which is appropriate for Tailscale ACL configurations.
- The `family` group configuration is not entirely correct; it should specify the use of servers as exit nodes without access to services.
- The `servers` group configuration is missing a rule to explicitly deny access to other ports.

**Assistant B:**
- Uses YAML format, which is not the standard for Tailscale ACL configurations.
- The configuration is more verbose and less precise.
- The `family` group configuration is not correctly implemented for exit-node usage.
- The `servers` group configuration is split into two rules, which is unnecessary and could be simplified.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant A's answer is closer to the correct format and implementation, though it has some minor issues. Assistant B's answer is less accurate and uses an incorrect format.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
