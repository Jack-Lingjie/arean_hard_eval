**Position Paper: Collaborative Innovation Initiative for Sustainable Critical Minerals Exploration and Processing**

**I. Introduction**

The global demand for critical minerals is rapidly increasing due to their essential role in modern technologies, renewable energy, and defense applications. However, the extraction and processing of these minerals often result in significant environmental impacts, including the generation of mining waste or tailings. This position paper presents an opportunity for collaboration on an innovation initiative focused on applying deep science and technology in the discovery, exploration, and processing of critical minerals while reducing the environmental impact of mining waste. The proposed Critical Minerals Innovation Testbed (CMIT) aims to attract mining companies to participate in a consortium through active contribution of resources, leading to a proposal for government and foundation grants.

**II. Feasibility of Extracting Critical Minerals from Mining Waste**

The extraction of critical minerals from mining waste is a feasible and promising approach to address both the increasing demand for these minerals and the environmental challenges associated with mining activities. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential for recovering valuable elements from tailings, including rare earth elements (REEs), lithium, cobalt, and other critical minerals. This approach not only reduces the need for new mining operations but also mitigates the environmental impact of existing waste deposits.

**III. Technological Solutions for the Critical Minerals Innovation Testbed**

The CMIT will explore and develop a range of technological solutions to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and environmental performance of critical mineral exploration and processing. These solutions may include:

1. **Advanced Mineral Exploration Technologies**: The application of remote sensing, geophysical, and geochemical techniques to identify and characterize critical mineral deposits with minimal environmental disturbance.
2. **Enhanced Recovery Methods**: The development of innovative extraction and processing techniques, such as bioleaching, ion exchange, and solvent extraction, to improve the recovery of critical minerals from low-grade ores and mining waste.
3. **Waste-to-Resource Conversion**: The implementation of technologies to extract valuable elements from mining waste, including tailings reprocessing, heap leaching, and in-situ recovery.
4. **Sustainable Mining Practices**: The adoption of best practices in mine planning, design, and operation to minimize environmental impacts, including water and energy conservation, land reclamation, and ecosystem restoration.
5. **Circular Economy Approaches**: The promotion of recycling, reuse, and substitution of critical minerals to reduce the reliance on primary resources and minimize waste generation.
6. **Environmental Monitoring and Assessment**: The use of advanced monitoring technologies, such as remote sensing and real-time data analytics, to assess the environmental performance of mining operations and inform decision-making.
7. **Regulatory and Policy Frameworks**: The development of guidelines, standards, and incentives to promote sustainable critical mineral exploration and processing, including environmental impact assessments, life cycle analysis, and certification schemes.

**IV. Consortium Formation and Grant Proposal Development**

The CMIT will bring together mining companies, research institutions, technology providers, and other stakeholders to collaborate on the development and implementation of innovative solutions for sustainable critical mineral exploration and processing. By actively contributing resources, expertise, and knowledge, consortium members will benefit from shared learning, reduced costs, and increased competitiveness in the global market.

The consortium will develop a comprehensive proposal for government and foundation grants, outlining the objectives, activities, expected outcomes, and budget of the CMIT. This proposal will demonstrate the potential of the initiative to address critical mineral supply chain challenges, contribute to economic growth, and promote environmental sustainability.

**V. Conclusion**

The proposed Critical Minerals Innovation Testbed presents a unique opportunity for collaboration among mining companies, researchers, and other stakeholders to advance the sustainable exploration and processing of critical minerals. By harnessing deep science and technology, the CMIT will not only enhance the competitiveness of the mining industry but also contribute to a more sustainable and resilient global critical mineral supply chain.
