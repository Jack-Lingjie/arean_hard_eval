To address the user prompt, we need to create a JavaScript function that finds an object by its name deep inside a given object without using recursion and returns the path used to reach the object. Here is a solution using a breadth-first search approach with a queue:

```javascript
function findObjectByName(obj, targetName) {
  const queue = [{ path: [], value: obj }];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const { path, value } = queue.shift();

    if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {
      if (value.name === targetName) {
        return path;
      }

      for (const key in value) {
        if (value.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
          queue.push({ path: [...path, key], value: value[key] });
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return null;
}

// Example usage:
const exampleObject = {
  a: {
    name: 'A',
    b: {
      name: 'B',
      c: {
        name: 'C',
      },
    },
  },
  d: {
    name: 'D',
  },
};

console.log(findObjectByName(exampleObject, 'C')); // Output: ["a", "b", "c"]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a queue with the root object and an empty path.
2. **Loop**: It enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty.
3. **Dequeue**: In each iteration, it dequeues the next object from the queue.
4. **Check**: It checks if the dequeued object has the target name. If it does, it returns the path to the object.
5. **Enqueue Children**: If the object does not match the name, it adds its child objects to the queue. Each child object is added with its path.
6. **Return**: If the loop completes without finding the object, it returns `null`.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant A correctly implements a breadth-first search using a queue and returns the path as an array of keys.
2. **Helpfulness**: The explanation is clear and matches the code provided.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt and addresses all parts of the request.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant B has a flaw. It checks if the current object contains the target name as a key, which is not the same as checking if the object's `name` property matches the target name. This does not meet the user's requirement.
2. **Helpfulness**: The explanation is detailed but does not match the correct implementation needed for the prompt.
3. **Relevance**: The response is not fully relevant because it does not correctly address the requirement to find an object by its `name` property.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is somewhat verbose and includes unnecessary details.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A's answer is more accurate and directly addresses the user's prompt correctly. Therefore, the final verdict is:

**Assistant A is significantly better: [[A>>B]]**
