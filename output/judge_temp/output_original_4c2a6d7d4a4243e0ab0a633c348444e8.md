To get daily stocks data from yfinance and plot it using Python, you'll need to install the `yfinance` and `matplotlib` libraries if you haven't already. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance matplotlib
```

Here's a Python script that fetches daily stock data for a specific stock (e.g., Apple Inc. with the ticker symbol 'AAPL') and plots the data using the `matplotlib` library:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the stock ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'

# Fetch the stock data
stock_data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-01-01', interval='1d')

# Plot the stock data
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(stock_data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.title(f'{ticker} Stock Price')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

Replace `'AAPL'` with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to fetch and plot. You can also adjust the `start` and `end` parameters to specify the date range for the stock data.

### Explanation

1. **Import Libraries**: 
   - `yfinance` for fetching stock data.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.

2. **Define Stock Ticker**: 
   - Specify the stock ticker symbol you're interested in.

3. **Fetch Daily Stock Data**:
   - Use `yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-01-01', interval='1d')` to download the daily stock data for the specified period.

4. **Plot Closing Price**:
   - Use `plt.plot` to create a line plot of the closing price over time.

5. **Customize Plot**:
   - Set the figure size.
   - Add a title and labels for the x and y axes.

6. **Display Legend and Plot**:
   - Show the legend.
   - Display the plot.

### Example Use Cases

- **Multiple Stocks**: To plot multiple stocks, simply modify the `ticker` variable to include the tickers of the stocks you're interested in.
- **Custom Period**: Adjust the `start` and `end` parameters in `yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-01-01', interval='1d')` to change the time period for which you want to fetch data.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation

**Assistant A:**
- Provides a clear and concise script.
- Uses `yf.download` with specific start and end dates.
- Includes installation instructions for required libraries.
- The plot is well-labeled and includes a legend and grid.

**Assistant B:**
- Also provides a clear and concise script.
- Uses `yf.Ticker(stock_ticker).history(period="1y")` to fetch data for the last year.
- Includes installation instructions for required libraries.
- The plot is well-labeled and includes a legend.
- Provides additional explanation and example use cases.

**Comparison:**
- Both answers are correct and provide a working solution.
- Assistant B's answer includes more detailed explanations and example use cases, which can be helpful for users who want to extend the functionality.
- Assistant A's answer is slightly more concise but lacks the additional context provided by Assistant B.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant B's answer is slightly better due to the additional explanations and example use cases, which add value for users looking to understand and extend the code.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
