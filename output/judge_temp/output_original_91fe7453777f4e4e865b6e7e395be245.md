### My Answer

To solve the two sum problem in Haskell, we need a function that takes a list of integers and a target integer, and returns a pair of integers from the list that sum to the target. If no such pair exists, the function should return `(-1, -1)`.

Here is a possible implementation:

```haskell
import qualified Data.Map as Map

twoSum :: [Int] -> Int -> (Int, Int)
twoSum nums target = go nums Map.empty
  where
    go [] _ = (-1, -1)
    go (x:xs) m =
      case Map.lookup (target - x) m of
        Just y  -> (y, x)
        Nothing -> go xs (Map.insert x x m)
```

### Explanation

1. **Imports**: We import `Data.Map` to use a map for efficient lookups.
2. **Function Signature**: `twoSum :: [Int] -> Int -> (Int, Int)`
   - The function takes a list of integers and a target integer.
   - It returns a tuple of two integers or `(-1, -1)` if no such pair exists.
3. **Helper Function `go`**:
   - `go` takes the remaining list and a map that keeps track of the numbers we have seen so far.
   - If the list is empty, it returns `(-1, -1)`.
   - For each number `x` in the list, it checks if `target - x` is in the map.
     - If it is, it returns the pair `(y, x)` where `y` is the value found in the map.
     - If it is not, it inserts `x` into the map and continues with the rest of the list.

### Example Usage

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
  let target = 9
  let result = twoSum nums target
  print result  -- Output: (2, 7)
```

This implementation ensures that we find the first pair of numbers that sum to the target efficiently using a map for lookups.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and B's Answers

#### Assistant A's Answer

1. **Correctness**: The function provided by Assistant A generates all possible pairs and checks if their sum equals the target. This approach is correct but inefficient.
2. **Efficiency**: The solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the generation of all pairs.
3. **Clarity**: The explanation is clear and the example usage is helpful.
4. **Edge Cases**: The function returns `(-1, -1)` if no pair is found, which is correct.

#### Assistant B's Answer

1. **Correctness**: The function provided by Assistant B has several issues:
   - The function signature is incorrect. It should return a tuple `(Int, Int)` instead of a list `[a]`.
   - The logic for finding the pair is flawed and does not correctly implement the two sum problem.
2. **Efficiency**: The approach is not efficient and the filtering logic is incorrect.
3. **Clarity**: The explanation is detailed but the provided code does not match the explanation.
4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases correctly due to the flawed logic.

### Final Verdict

Assistant A's answer is correct and clear, though not the most efficient. Assistant B's answer contains significant errors in both the function signature and logic.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
