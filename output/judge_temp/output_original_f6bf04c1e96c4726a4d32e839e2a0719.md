To convert a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 is the best and 7 is the worst, to an index between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best, you can use a simple linear transformation. The transformation should map 1 to 1 and 7 to 0. 

Here's a Python function to achieve this:

```python
def convert_to_index(number):
    if number < 1 or number > 7:
        raise ValueError("Input number must be between 1 and 7")
    return (7 - number) / 6

# Example usage:
number = 3
index = convert_to_index(number)
print(index)  # Output: 0.6666666666666666
```

This function works by subtracting the input number from 7 and then dividing by 6. This way, the best value (1) will be converted to an index of 1, and the worst value (7) will be converted to an index of 0.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- The function provided is correct and achieves the desired transformation.
- The explanation is clear and concise.
- The example usage is helpful.
- The formula used is `1 - (number - 1) / 6`, which is mathematically equivalent to `(7 - number) / 6`.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- The function provided is also correct and achieves the desired transformation.
- The explanation is detailed and includes docstrings, which is a good practice.
- The example use cases are very helpful for understanding the function's behavior.
- The formula used is `(7 - score) / 6`, which is the same as the one I used in my answer.

Both answers are correct and provide clear, helpful, and concise explanations. However, Assistant B's answer includes more detailed documentation and example use cases, which can be very beneficial for users who might need additional context or examples.

### Final Verdict
Assistant B's answer is slightly better due to the additional documentation and example use cases provided.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
