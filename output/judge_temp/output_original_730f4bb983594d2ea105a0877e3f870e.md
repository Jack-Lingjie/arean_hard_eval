To write a Kalman filter in GNU Octave, we need to implement both the prediction and update steps of the filter. Here is a basic implementation:

```octave
function [x_est, P] = kalman_filter(x_est, P, A, Q, H, R, z)
  % x_est: initial state estimate
  % P: initial state covariance
  % A: state transition matrix
  % Q: process noise covariance
  % H: observation matrix
  % R: observation noise covariance
  % z: observation

  % Prediction step
  x_pred = A * x_est;
  P_pred = A * P * A' + Q;

  % Update step
  K = P_pred * H' / (H * P_pred * H' + R);
  x_est = x_pred + K * (z - H * x_pred);
  P = (eye(size(P)) - K * H) * P_pred;
end
```

To use this function, you need to define the initial state estimate `x_est`, initial state covariance `P`, state transition matrix `A`, process noise covariance `Q`, observation matrix `H`, observation noise covariance `R`, and the observation `z`. Here is an example of how to use the Kalman filter function:

```octave
% Define the system parameters
A = [1, 1; 0, 1];
Q = [0.001, 0; 0, 0.001];
H = [1, 0];
R = 0.01;

% Define the initial state estimate and covariance
x_est = [0; 0];
P = [1, 0; 0, 1];

% Generate some observations
n = 100;
z = linspace(0, 10, n) + randn(1, n) * sqrt(R);

% Apply the Kalman filter
x_est_history = zeros(2, n);
for i = 1:n
  [x_est, P] = kalman_filter(x_est, P, A, Q, H, R, z(i));
  x_est_history(:, i) = x_est;
end

% Plot the results
figure;
plot(z, 'r', 'DisplayName', 'Observations');
hold on;
plot(x_est_history(1, :), 'b', 'DisplayName', 'Kalman Filter Estimates');
legend('show');
xlabel('Time');
ylabel('Position');
title('Kalman Filter Example');
```

This example demonstrates a simple 1D position and velocity tracking problem. The Kalman filter estimates the position and velocity of an object based on noisy observations of its position.
