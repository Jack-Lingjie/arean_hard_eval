Here is a recipe for making 5 liters of strawberry and blackberry melomel using metric measurements:

### Ingredients:
- 2 kg honey (preferably a light variety like clover or orange blossom)
- 1.5 kg fresh strawberries
- 1.5 kg fresh blackberries
- 4.5 L water
- 1 tsp yeast nutrient
- 1 tsp pectic enzyme
- 1 packet wine yeast (e.g., Lalvin 71B-1122 or Red Star Premier Cuvee)

### Instructions:

1. **Sanitize Equipment:**
   - Sanitize all equipment that will come into contact with the melomel, including the fermenter, airlock, stirring spoon, and any other tools.

2. **Prepare the Fruit:**
   - Rinse the strawberries and blackberries thoroughly. Remove any stems or leaves, and cut the strawberries into halves or quarters.

3. **Create the Must:**
   - In a large pot, bring 2.5 L of water to a boil. Once boiling, remove from heat and slowly stir in the honey until it is fully dissolved. This mixture is called "must."

4. **Cool the Must:**
   - Allow the must to cool to room temperature (around 20-25°C). While waiting, add the strawberries and blackberries to the fermenter.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Once the must has cooled, pour it into the fermenter over the fruit. Add the remaining 2 L of water to the fermenter, making sure the total volume is 5 L.

6. **Add Additives:**
   - Add the pectic enzyme and yeast nutrient to the fermenter, and stir gently to combine.

7. **Pitch the Yeast:**
   - Hydrate the wine yeast according to the packet instructions, then add it to the fermenter. Stir gently to mix the yeast into the must.

8. **Fermentation:**
   - Seal the fermenter with an airlock, and store it in a dark, temperature-stable area (ideally 18-22°C).
   - Allow the melomel to ferment for 2-3 weeks, or until fermentation activity has stopped. You can check this by observing the airlock for a lack of bubbling.

9. **Rack the Melomel:**
   - Once fermentation is complete, use a sanitized siphon to rack the melomel into a clean, sanitized secondary fermenter, leaving behind the fruit and sediment.

10. **Secondary Fermentation:**
    - Attach the airlock to the secondary fermenter, and let the melomel age for at least 2-3 months. For a smoother, more refined flavor, you can age it for up to a year.

11. **Bottling:**
    - After aging, siphon the melomel into sanitized bottles, leaving behind any remaining sediment. Seal the bottles with corks or caps.

12. **Aging:**
    - Allow the bottled melomel to age for an additional 3-6 months before enjoying. The flavor will continue to improve with time.

### Notes:
- Always sanitize your equipment to prevent contamination and spoilage.
- Use a hydrometer to monitor the specific gravity of the must before and after fermentation to determine the alcohol content.

### Evaluation:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- **Accuracy:** The recipe is accurate and detailed, covering all necessary steps and ingredients.
- **Helpfulness:** The instructions are clear and easy to follow, making it helpful for someone new to making melomel.
- **Relevance:** The response is entirely relevant to the prompt.
- **Conciseness:** The response is concise but thorough, providing all necessary details without being overly verbose.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- **Accuracy:** The recipe is mostly accurate but uses granulated sugar instead of honey, which is not traditional for melomel (a type of mead).
- **Helpfulness:** The instructions are clear but lack some details, such as the use of pectic enzyme and yeast nutrient, which are important for fruit-based meads.
- **Relevance:** The response is relevant but deviates from the traditional melomel recipe by using granulated sugar.
- **Conciseness:** The response is concise but misses some important details that would be beneficial for the user.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant A provides a more accurate and traditional recipe for strawberry and blackberry melomel, including all necessary steps and ingredients. Assistant B's recipe, while clear, deviates from the traditional use of honey and lacks some important details.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
