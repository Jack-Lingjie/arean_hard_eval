**Sample Dialog for English Speaking Practice: Booking a Hotel and Taxi Before a Business Trip**

**Speaker 1:** Hi, I need to book a hotel and a taxi for my upcoming business trip. Can you help me with that?

**Speaker 2:** Sure, I'd be happy to help. When are you planning to go on your trip?

**Speaker 1:** I'll be traveling next month, from the 15th to the 20th.

**Speaker 2:** Great. Let's start with the hotel. Do you have any specific preferences or budget in mind?

**Speaker 1:** I'd prefer a 4-star hotel, and my budget is around $150 per night. If there were a hotel with a gym and a pool, that would be perfect.

**Speaker 2:** Alright, I found a hotel that meets your requirements. It's called "The Business Plaza" and it's located near the city center. The price is $145 per night, and it has a gym and a pool.

**Speaker 1:** That sounds great! Please book it for me.

**Speaker 2:** Sure, I'll book it for you. Now, let's move on to the taxi. Do you want me to book a taxi for your entire stay or just for specific days?

**Speaker 1:** I'll need a taxi from the airport to the hotel on the 15th, and then from the hotel to the airport on the 20th. I'll be using public transportation during my stay.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, I can arrange that for you. If you provide me with your flight details, I can make sure the taxi is waiting for you when you arrive.

**Speaker 1:** My flight arrives at 3:00 PM on the 15th, and my departure flight is at 6:00 PM on the 20th.

**Speaker 2:** Great, I'll book the taxi accordingly. If your flight were to be delayed, would you like me to include a note for the taxi driver to check your flight status?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, please do that. I appreciate your help.

**Speaker 2:** No problem at all. I've booked the hotel and the taxi for you. Have a great business trip!
