To extract hashtags from a text in C#, you can use Regular Expressions. Here is a simple example using the `Regex` class from the `System.Text.RegularExpressions` namespace:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string text = "This is a sample text with #hashtag1, #hashtag2 and #hashtag3.";
        List<string> hashtags = ExtractHashtags(text);

        Console.WriteLine("Hashtags found:");
        foreach (string hashtag in hashtags)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(hashtag);
        }
    }

    static List<string> ExtractHashtags(string text)
    {
        List<string> hashtags = new List<string>();
        Regex hashtagPattern = new Regex(@"#(\w+)");

        foreach (Match match in hashtagPattern.Matches(text))
        {
            hashtags.Add(match.Groups[1].Value);
        }

        return hashtags;
    }
}
```

This code defines a method `ExtractHashtags` that takes a string as input and returns a list of hashtags found in the text. The method uses a regular expression `#(\w+)` to match hashtags. The `#` part matches the hashtag symbol, and `(\w+)` captures one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores) following the hashtag symbol. The captured group is then added to the list of hashtags.

### Explanation:
- **Regular Expression Pattern**: The pattern `#(\w+)` matches any text that starts with a `#` symbol followed by one or more word characters (`\w+`).
- **`Regex.Matches` Method**: This method finds all matches of the pattern in the text.
- **Populating the Hashtags List**: The matched hashtags are extracted and stored in a list.

This approach efficiently extracts hashtags from a given text using regular expressions.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant A is correct and functional. It uses a regular expression to find hashtags and returns them in a list.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful as it provides a complete, working example.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.
5. **Explanation**: The explanation is clear, but it could be improved by explaining the regular expression pattern in more detail.

### Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant B is also correct and functional. It uses a regular expression to find hashtags and returns them in an array.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and provides a complete, working example.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.
5. **Explanation**: The explanation is detailed and covers the regular expression pattern and the method used.

### Comparison:
- Both answers are correct and provide working examples.
- Assistant B's explanation is more detailed and covers the regular expression pattern and the method used more thoroughly.
- Assistant A's answer uses a list to store hashtags, while Assistant B's answer uses an array. Both approaches are valid, but lists are generally more flexible in C#.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant B's answer is slightly better due to the more detailed explanation and thorough coverage of the regular expression pattern and method used.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
