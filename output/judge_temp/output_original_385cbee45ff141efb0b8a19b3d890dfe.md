When troubleshooting an injection molding machine where the oil pump motor and oil pump start but no pressure is generated, follow these steps:

1. **Check Oil Level**: Ensure the oil reservoir is filled to the appropriate level. Low oil levels can prevent the pump from generating pressure.

2. **Inspect Oil Filter**: A clogged oil filter can restrict oil flow and cause a drop in pressure. Check and replace the filter if necessary.

3. **Examine Oil Pump**: Inspect the oil pump for signs of wear or damage. If the pump is malfunctioning, it may need to be repaired or replaced.

4. **Pressure Relief Valve**: Check the pressure relief valve to ensure it is not stuck open or malfunctioning. A faulty valve can cause a loss of pressure.

5. **Hydraulic Hoses and Connections**: Inspect all hydraulic hoses and connections for leaks or damage. Repair or replace any faulty components.

6. **Hydraulic Pump Drive Coupling**: The coupling between the motor and the pump can wear out or become damaged. Inspect and replace if necessary.

7. **Pressure Gauge**: Verify the accuracy of the pressure gauge. A faulty gauge may not display the correct pressure.

8. **Hydraulic System**: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, there may be a problem within the hydraulic system itself. Consult a hydraulic specialist or the machine manufacturer for further assistance.

Always follow safety procedures and guidelines when working on industrial machines. If you are unsure about any steps, consult with a qualified technician or the machine manufacturer.
