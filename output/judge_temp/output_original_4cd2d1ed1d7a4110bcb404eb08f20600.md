To convert the Pathfinder Cryptic class to 5e D&D, we need to ensure that the class features are balanced and fit within the 5e framework. Here is a suggested conversion:

### Cryptic Class (5e D&D)

**Hit Points**
- Hit Dice: 1d8 per Cryptic level
- Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
- Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Cryptic level after 1st

**Proficiencies**
- Armor: Light armor
- Weapons: Simple weapons
- Tools: Thieves' tools
- Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom
- Skills: Choose three from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Investigation, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth

**Equipment**
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (a) a dagger or (b) a quarterstaff
- (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
- (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
- Leather armor, thieves' tools, and a simple weapon

### Class Features

**1st Level: Patternweaving, Disrupt Pattern**
- **Patternweaving**: You gain the ability to manipulate patterns and weave them into spells. You know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cryptic table.
- **Disrupt Pattern**: You can use your action to disrupt the patterns of a creature within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check. The damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

**2nd Level: Archetype Feature**
- Choose an archetype that represents your focus as a Cryptic: Pattern Breaker, Pattern Weaver, or Pattern Thief. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 15th, and 18th level.

**3rd Level: Evasion**
- Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**4th Level: Ability Score Improvement**

**5th Level: Archetype Feature**

**6th Level: Pattern Sight**
- You gain the ability to see the patterns of magic and creatures. You can cast detect magic and see invisibility at will, without expending a spell slot.

**7th Level: Archetype Feature**

**8th Level: Ability Score Improvement**

**9th Level: Improved Disrupt Pattern**
- When you use your Disrupt Pattern feature, you can target two creatures within range.

**10th Level: Archetype Feature**

**11th Level: Greater Patternweaving**
- You can cast one 1st-level wizard spell of your choice without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

**12th Level: Ability Score Improvement**

**13th Level: Archetype Feature**

**14th Level: Pattern Mastery**
- You gain advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**15th Level: Archetype Feature**

**18th Level: Archetype Feature**
