**Technical Requirements Specification for a Diagnostic System for Sepsis Detection in European Hospital Settings**

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to outline the technical requirements for a diagnostic system (reader and consumable) that uses a blood sample to detect sepsis in a European hospital setting. This system aims to provide rapid, accurate, and reliable results to aid healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.

**1.2 Scope**
This document covers the technical requirements for the diagnostic system, including the reader, consumable, and software components. It also addresses the performance, safety, and regulatory requirements for the system.

**2. System Overview**

**2.1 System Components**
The diagnostic system consists of the following components:
- **Reader**: A device that processes and analyzes the blood sample.
- **Consumable**: A single-use cartridge containing the necessary reagents for the detection of sepsis.
- **Software**: A user interface for the reader that displays the results and manages the data.

**2.2 System Workflow**
The diagnostic system workflow includes the following steps:
1. Blood sample collection from the patient.
2. Insertion of the blood sample into the consumable cartridge.
3. Insertion of the consumable cartridge into the reader.
4. Analysis of the blood sample by the reader.
5. Display of the results on the software interface.

**3. Technical Requirements**

**3.1 Reader**

**3.1.1 Performance**
- The reader must provide accurate and reliable results within 30 minutes.
- The reader must have a sensitivity of at least 95% and a specificity of at least 90% for the detection of sepsis.
- The reader must be able to process a minimum of 10 samples simultaneously.

**3.1.2 Design**
- The reader must be compact and portable, with dimensions not exceeding 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm.
- The reader must have a user-friendly interface with a touchscreen display.
- The reader must have a USB port for data transfer and software updates.

**3.1.3 Safety**
- The reader must comply with the European Union's Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards for electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility.

**3.2 Consumable**

**3.2.1 Performance**
- The consumable must be compatible with the reader and provide accurate and reliable results.
- The consumable must have a shelf life of at least 12 months at room temperature.

**3.2.2 Design**
- The consumable must be a single-use cartridge containing all necessary reagents for the detection of sepsis.
- The consumable must be easy to handle and insert into the reader.

**3.2.3 Safety**
- The consumable must be sealed and sterile to prevent contamination.
- The consumable must comply with the European Union's In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR).

**3.3 Software**

**3.3.1 Performance**
- The software must provide a user-friendly interface for the reader, displaying the results and managing the data.
- The software must be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

**3.3.2 Design**
- The software must display the results in a clear and concise format, including the patient's information, test results, and interpretation.
- The software must allow for data storage and retrieval, as well as the ability to export data in standard formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).

**3.3.3 Security**
- The software must comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data.

**4. Regulatory Requirements**
The diagnostic system must comply with all relevant European Union regulations, including but not limited to:
- Medical Device Regulation (MDR) for the reader.
- In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) for the consumable.
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the software.

**5. Conclusion**
This document outlines the technical requirements for a diagnostic system for sepsis detection in European hospital settings. The system must provide rapid, accurate, and reliable results, while complying with all relevant regulations and standards. By meeting these requirements, the diagnostic system will aid healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
