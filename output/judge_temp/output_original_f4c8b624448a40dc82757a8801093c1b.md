### My Answer:

**Verse 1**
Down by the river, where the waters flow free,
I saw a catfish swimmin', lookin' right at me,
With whiskers long and eyes so deep,
In the muddy waters, secrets they keep.

**Chorus**
Oh, catfish, catfish, swimmin' in the night,
You glide through the waters, out of sight,
With your secrets hidden, in the river's flow,
Oh, catfish, catfish, what do you know?

**Verse 2**
You've seen the ages pass, from the river's birth,
Through the storms and calm, the laughter and the mirth,
A silent witness to the tales untold,
In the murky depths, where the waters roll.

**Chorus**
Oh, catfish, catfish, swimmin' in the night,
You glide through the waters, out of sight,
With your secrets hidden, in the river's flow,
Oh, catfish, catfish, what do you know?

**Bridge**
Some say you're a phantom, a ghost in the stream,
Others say you're a legend, a fisherman's dream,
But I see you as a wanderer, in the river's embrace,
A creature of the night, in this timeless place.

**Verse 3**
From the dawn of time, you've swum these veins,
Through the sun and the moon, the joys and the pains,
A guardian of the river, in the shadows you lie,
Oh, catfish, catfish, under the sky.

**Chorus**
Oh, catfish, catfish, swimmin' in the night,
You glide through the waters, out of sight,
With your secrets hidden, in the river's flow,
Oh, catfish, catfish, what do you know?

**Outro**
So I'll sing of the catfish, in the river so wide,
A symbol of the mysteries, in the waters they hide,
For in the depths of the river, where the currents twist and bend,
Oh, catfish, catfish, you're a timeless friend.
