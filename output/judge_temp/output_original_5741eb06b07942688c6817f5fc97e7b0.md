To create a JavaScript function that extracts the text from a document, you can use the following approach:

```javascript
function extractTextFromDocument(document) {
  return document.body.textContent || document.body.innerText;
}

// Usage example:
const textContent = extractTextFromDocument(document);
console.log(textContent);
```

This function takes a `document` object as an argument and returns the text content of the document by accessing the `textContent` property of the `body` element. The `textContent` property is preferred over `innerText` because it includes all the text content of the document, including hidden elements, whereas `innerText` only includes visible text.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `extractTextFromDocument` takes a `document` object as a parameter.
2. **Text Extraction**: It returns the text content of the document's body using the `textContent` property. If `textContent` is not available, it falls back to `innerText`.
3. **Usage Example**: The function is called with the `document` object, and the extracted text is logged to the console.

### Example Use Case:
- **Web Scraping**: This function can be used in web scraping scripts to extract text content from web pages.
- **Text Analysis**: The extracted text can be used for text analysis, such as sentiment analysis or keyword extraction.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- **Correctness**: The function provided by Assistant A correctly extracts the text content from the document using `innerText`.
- **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt.
- **Conciseness**: The answer is concise and to the point.
- **Missing Information**: It does not mention the use of `textContent`, which is generally more comprehensive than `innerText`.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- **Correctness**: The function provided by Assistant B uses `DOMParser` to parse an HTML string and then extracts the text content using `textContent`.
- **Relevance**: The answer is relevant but assumes the input is an HTML string rather than a `document` object.
- **Conciseness**: The answer is more verbose and includes additional explanations and use cases.
- **Missing Information**: It does not directly address the prompt, which asks for a function that extracts text from a `document` object, not an HTML string.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the prompt, as it directly addresses extracting text from a `document` object. Assistant B's answer, while informative, assumes a different input type and is more verbose.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
