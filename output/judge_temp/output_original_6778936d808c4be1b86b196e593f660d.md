To create a 500x500 px square with a rounded top-right corner in After Effects, you can use the following expression in the Path property of a shape layer:

```javascript
// Define the size of the square
var squareSize = 500;

// Define the radius of the rounded corner
var cornerRadius = 50;

// Define the points of the square
var topLeft = [0, 0];
var topRight = [squareSize - cornerRadius, 0];
var bottomRight = [squareSize, squareSize];
var bottomLeft = [0, squareSize];

// Create the rounded corner using a bezier curve
var handleLength = cornerRadius * 0.552284749831;
var handleIn = [topRight[0] + handleLength, topRight[1]];
var handleOut = [topRight[0], topRight[1] - handleLength];
var roundedTopRight = [topRight, handleIn, handleOut];

// Create the path
var path = createPath([topLeft, topRight, roundedTopRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft], [], [], true);

path;
```

This expression creates a 500x500 px square with a 50 px rounded top-right corner. You can adjust the `squareSize` and `cornerRadius` variables to change the size of the square and the radius of the rounded corner, respectively.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and B's Answers

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- **Correctness:** The expression provided by Assistant A is mostly correct but has a mistake in the `createPath` function call. The `createPath` function should include all points in the path array, not separate the rounded corner.
- **Helpfulness:** The answer is helpful and provides a clear explanation of the variables and their purpose.
- **Relevance:** The answer is relevant to the prompt.
- **Conciseness:** The answer is concise but could be slightly more detailed in explaining the `createPath` function.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- **Correctness:** The expression provided by Assistant B is incorrect. It does not properly create a rounded corner using bezier curves and misses the `createPath` function.
- **Helpfulness:** The answer is less helpful because it does not achieve the desired result of a rounded corner.
- **Relevance:** The answer is relevant but does not fully address the prompt.
- **Conciseness:** The answer is concise but lacks the necessary detail to create the rounded corner.

### Final Verdict
Assistant A's answer is more accurate and helpful, despite a minor mistake in the `createPath` function call. Assistant B's answer does not correctly address the prompt.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
