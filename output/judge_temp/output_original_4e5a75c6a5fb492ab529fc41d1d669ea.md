To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the sum of 100 fair six-sided dice, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Mean and Standard Deviation of a Single Die:**
   - The mean (μ) of a single six-sided die is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = 3.5
     \]
   - The variance (σ²) of a single six-sided die is:
     \[
     \sigma^2 = \frac{(1-3.5)^2 + (2-3.5)^2 + (3-3.5)^2 + (4-3.5)^2 + (5-3.5)^2 + (6-3.5)^2}{6} = \frac{17.5}{6} \approx 2.92
     \]
   - The standard deviation (σ) is the square root of the variance:
     \[
     \sigma = \sqrt{2.92} \approx 1.71
     \]

2. **Calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the Sum of 100 Dice:**
   - The mean of the sum of 100 dice is:
     \[
     \mu_{\text{sum}} = 100 \times 3.5 = 350
     \]
   - The standard deviation of the sum of 100 dice is:
     \[
     \sigma_{\text{sum}} = \sqrt{100} \times 1.71 = 17.1
     \]

3. **Determine the 95% Confidence Interval:**
   - For a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is approximately 1.96.
   - The margin of error (ME) is:
     \[
     \text{ME} = 1.96 \times 17.1 \approx 33.516
     \]
   - The confidence interval is:
     \[
     \text{CI} = \left(350 - 33.516, 350 + 33.516\right) = (316.484, 383.516)
     \]

Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the sum of 100 fair six-sided dice is approximately (316.484, 383.516).
