**My Answer:**

The title "Pharaoh" originates from the ancient Egyptian term "Per-aa," which translates to "Great House." Initially, this term referred to the royal palace itself but eventually came to denote the ruler of Egypt. The evolution of the term reflects the increasing centralization of power in the figure of the king.

**Linguistic Evolution:**

1. **Old Kingdom (c. 2686-2181 BCE):** The ruler was referred to as "Nesu" or "Nesut," meaning "King" or "Ruler."
2. **Middle Kingdom (c. 2055-1650 BCE):** The title "Nesut-Bity" was used, translating to "King of Upper and Lower Egypt." "Per-aa" still referred to the palace.
3. **New Kingdom (c. 1550-1070 BCE):** The term "Per-aa" began to be associated with the ruler, leading to the title "Pharaoh." This shift likely occurred due to the growing power of the monarchy.

**Uses During Antiquity:**

In antiquity, the title "Pharaoh" was used to refer to the ruler of Egypt, who was considered a divine intermediary between the gods and the people. The Pharaoh was responsible for maintaining Ma'at (cosmic order) and ensuring the country's prosperity. Both male and female rulers, such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra, used the title.

**Modern Usage:**

Today, "Pharaoh" is used to refer to the ancient rulers of Egypt, especially those from the New Kingdom period. The term is prevalent in historical and archaeological contexts and has also permeated popular culture, symbolizing great power or authority.

**Across Geographies:**

While the title "Pharaoh" was primarily used in ancient Egypt, its influence extended to neighboring regions like Nubia and the Near East through diplomacy and conquest. The Greeks and Romans adopted the term, using it in their writings to refer to Egyptian kings. Today, the title is globally recognized and used in various historical, archaeological, and cultural contexts.
