To migrate your open tabs from Safari 14 on MacOS Mojave to Safari 17 on MacOS Sonoma, you can follow these steps:

### Using Bookmarks to Transfer Tabs

1. **Export Bookmarks from Safari 14:**
   - Open Safari on your old Mac.
   - Go to **File** > **Export Bookmarks**.
   - Save the exported bookmarks file (e.g., `Safari Bookmarks.html`) to a location you can easily access, such as your Desktop or a USB drive.

2. **Transfer the Bookmarks File:**
   - Transfer the exported bookmarks file to your new Mac using a USB drive, AirDrop, or any other file transfer method.

3. **Import Bookmarks into Safari 17:**
   - Open Safari on your new Mac.
   - Go to **File** > **Import From** > **Bookmarks HTML File**.
   - Locate and select the exported bookmarks file.
   - Click **Import** to import the bookmarks into Safari 17.

4. **Open All Imported Bookmarks as Tabs:**
   - In Safari 17, go to **Bookmarks** > **Show Bookmarks**.
   - Locate the folder containing the imported bookmarks (it might be named "Imported" or similar).
   - Right-click (or Control-click) on the folder and select **Open in New Tabs**.

This method will open all the bookmarks from your old Mac as new tabs in Safari 17 on your new Mac.

### Using a Third-Party Extension (Alternative Method)

If you prefer not to use bookmarks, you can use a third-party extension to transfer your tabs:

1. **Install a Tab Management Extension:**
   - On your old Mac, open Safari and go to **Safari** > **Preferences** > **Extensions**.
   - Search for and install a tab management extension like **OneTab** or **TabCloud**.

2. **Export Tabs Using the Extension:**
   - Follow the extension's instructions to export your open tabs.

3. **Install the Extension on Your New Mac:**
   - On your new Mac, open Safari and go to **Safari** > **Preferences** > **Extensions**.
   - Install the same tab management extension.

4. **Import Tabs Using the Extension:**
   - Follow the extension's instructions to import your tabs.

This method allows you to transfer your open tabs without using bookmarks, but it requires the use of a third-party extension.

### Note:
- Safari 14 does not support iCloud tabs, so you cannot use iCloud to sync your open tabs directly.
- Ensure that the third-party extension you choose is compatible with both Safari 14 and Safari 17.

Choose the method that best fits your needs and preferences.
