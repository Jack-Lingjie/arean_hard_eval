To count the number of events every minute since one month ago in Databricks SQL, you can use the following query:

```sql
WITH
  -- Generate a series of timestamps for every minute in the past month
  minute_series AS (
    SELECT
      sequence(
        date_trunc('MINUTE', current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH),
        date_trunc('MINUTE', current_timestamp()),
        INTERVAL 1 MINUTE
      ) AS minute
    FROM
      (SELECT 1)
  ),
  -- Flatten the array of timestamps into individual rows
  minutes AS (
    SELECT
      minute
    FROM
      minute_series
    LATERAL VIEW
      explode(minute) t AS minute
  )
SELECT
  m.minute,
  COUNT(e.event_id) AS event_count
FROM
  minutes m
  LEFT JOIN your_table_name e
    ON date_trunc('MINUTE', e.event_at) = m.minute
    AND e.event_at >= current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH
GROUP BY
  m.minute
ORDER BY
  m.minute;
```

Replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table. This query generates a series of timestamps for every minute in the past month, then flattens the array into individual rows. It then performs a LEFT JOIN with your table, aggregating the count of events for each minute.

### Explanation:
1. **minute_series**: Generates a sequence of timestamps for every minute in the past month.
2. **minutes**: Flattens the array of timestamps into individual rows.
3. **Final SELECT**: Performs a LEFT JOIN with the events table, counts the number of events for each minute, and orders the results by minute.

This approach ensures that even minutes with zero events are included in the result set.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and B's Answers:

**Assistant A:**
- Provides a comprehensive solution that generates a series of timestamps for every minute in the past month.
- Uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure that even minutes with zero events are included.
- The query is well-structured and follows best practices for the given task.

**Assistant B:**
- Extracts the minute part from the timestamp but does not generate a complete series of minutes for the past month.
- This approach will not include minutes with zero events.
- The query groups by the minute part of the timestamp, which is not suitable for counting events per minute over a month-long period.

### Conclusion:
Assistant A's answer is more accurate and complete for the given task. It ensures that all minutes in the past month are accounted for, even if there are no events in some minutes. Assistant B's answer is incorrect as it does not generate a complete series of minutes and will not provide the desired result.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
