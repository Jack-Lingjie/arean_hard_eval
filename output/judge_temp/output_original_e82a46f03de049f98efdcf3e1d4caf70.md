### My Answer

The error in the provided code is due to a missing space between the two concatenated strings in the SQL query. When the strings are concatenated, there is no space between "permissions" and "ON", which causes the syntax error. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Fetch authorized users for the given device
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT users.key FROM users INNER JOIN permissions "
    "ON users.key = permissions.user_key WHERE permissions.device_id = ?",
    (device_id,),
)
authorized_users = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
```

In this corrected version, a space is added at the end of the first string or at the beginning of the second string to ensure proper SQL syntax.
