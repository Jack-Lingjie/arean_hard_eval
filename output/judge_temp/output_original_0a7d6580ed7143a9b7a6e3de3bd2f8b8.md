**My Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

- 3 pears at 25 cents each: \(3 \times 25 = 75\) cents
- 1 lemon at 10 cents: 10 cents

Total cost: \(75 + 10 = 85\) cents

Now, let's calculate the change you will receive when you pay with a 1 dollar bill (100 cents):

Change: \(100 - 85 = 15\) cents

To get an odd number of coins for 15 cents, you can consider the following combinations:
- 1 coin of 10 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents (2 coins, which is even)
- 3 coins of 5 cents (3 coins, which is odd)

Since you prefer an odd number of coins, the best combination is 3 coins of 5 cents.

**Final Answer:**
You will get 3 coins of 5 cents each.

**Evaluation:**

**Assistant A's Answer:**

1. **Accuracy:** Assistant A correctly calculates the total cost and the change. The final combination of coins (1 coin of 10 cents and 2 coins of 5 cents) is accurate and results in an odd number of coins.
2. **Helpfulness:** The answer is helpful and directly addresses the user's preference for an odd number of coins.
3. **Relevance:** The response is relevant to the user's request.
4. **Conciseness:** The response is clear and concise.

**Assistant B's Answer:**

1. **Accuracy:** Assistant B correctly calculates the total cost and the change. However, the final combinations provided include one that results in an even number of coins (1 coin of 10 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents), which does not meet the user's preference for an odd number of coins.
2. **Helpfulness:** The answer is partially helpful but includes an option that does not align with the user's preference.
3. **Relevance:** The response is mostly relevant but includes an irrelevant coin combination.
4. **Conciseness:** The response is clear but slightly verbose in presenting multiple combinations.

**Final Verdict:**

Assistant A's answer is more accurate and directly aligns with the user's preference for an odd number of coins. Assistant B's answer, while mostly correct, includes an irrelevant option that does not meet the user's criteria.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
