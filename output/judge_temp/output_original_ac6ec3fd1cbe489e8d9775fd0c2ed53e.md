To create a new model by combining multiple pre-trained encoders or decoders, you can follow these steps:

1. **Select Pre-trained Models**: Choose the pre-trained encoders or decoders that you want to combine. Ensure that these models are compatible in terms of architecture and ideally trained on similar tasks for better performance.

2. **Load the Models**: Load the pre-trained models using their respective libraries. For example, if you are using Hugging Face's Transformers library, you can load the models using the `AutoModel.from_pretrained()` method.

3. **Combine the Models**: There are different strategies to combine the models, depending on your specific use case:
   - **Stacking**: You can stack the encoders or decoders sequentially, where the output of one model becomes the input of the next model. This can be done by creating a new model class that inherits from the base model class and implementing the forward method to pass the input through each encoder or decoder in sequence.
   - **Ensemble**: You can create an ensemble of models, where each model processes the input independently, and their outputs are combined using a specific strategy (e.g., averaging, voting, or concatenation). To implement this, create a new model class that takes a list of pre-trained models and combines their outputs in the forward method.

4. **Fine-tune the Combined Model**: To adapt the combined model to your specific task, you may need to fine-tune it on your target dataset. This can be done using standard training procedures, such as gradient descent optimization and backpropagation.

5. **Evaluate the Performance**: After fine-tuning, evaluate the performance of the combined model on a validation or test dataset to ensure that it meets your desired performance criteria.

Hereâ€™s an example using Hugging Face's Transformers library to stack two BERT encoders:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoConfig
import torch.nn as nn

class StackedBERTModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_name_1, model_name_2):
        super(StackedBERTModel, self).__init__()
        self.encoder_1 = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name_1)
        self.encoder_2 = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name_2)

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs_1 = self.encoder_1(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        outputs_2 = self.encoder_2(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        # Combine the outputs in a specific way, e.g., concatenation or averaging
        combined_outputs = (outputs_1[0] + outputs_2[0]) / 2
        return combined_outputs

model_name_1 = "bert-base-uncased"
model_name_2 = "bert-base-cased"
stacked_model = StackedBERTModel(model_name_1, model_name_2)
```

Remember that combining multiple pre-trained models may increase the complexity and computational requirements of the resulting model.
