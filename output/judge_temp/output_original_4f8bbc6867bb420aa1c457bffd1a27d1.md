To flash a Corne keyboard that has VIA installed, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Latest Firmware:**
   - Visit the QMK Firmware repository (https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and download the latest version as a ZIP file or clone the repository using Git.

2. **Set Up the Build Environment:**
   - Follow the instructions on the QMK documentation (https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started) to set up the build environment for your operating system.

3. **Customize Your Keymap (Optional):**
   - If you want to customize your keymap, navigate to the `keyboards/crkbd/keymaps` folder in the QMK Firmware repository. Copy the `default` or `via` folder and rename it to create your own keymap folder. Edit the `keymap.c` file in your new folder to customize your keymap.

4. **Build the Firmware:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root of the QMK Firmware repository, and run the following command to build the firmware:
     ```
     qmk compile -kb crkbd -km via
     ```
     Replace `via` with the name of your custom keymap folder if you created one. The firmware file will be generated with a `.hex` or `.bin` extension.

5. **Put Your Corne Keyboard into Bootloader Mode:**
   - Disconnect the keyboard from your computer. Hold the reset button on the keyboard (usually located on the bottom of the PCB) and reconnect the keyboard to your computer. Release the reset button. The keyboard is now in bootloader mode.

6. **Flash the Firmware:**
   - Open the QMK Toolbox (https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases) or use the command line to flash the firmware. If using QMK Toolbox, select the firmware file you built earlier and click the "Flash" button. If using the command line, run the following command, replacing "path/to/firmware.hex" with the actual path to your firmware file and "COM_PORT" with the appropriate port for your keyboard:
     ```
     avrdude -p atmega32u4 -c avr109 -U flash:w:path/to/firmware.hex:i -P COM_PORT
     ```
     Wait for the flashing process to complete.

7. **Configure Your Keyboard with VIA:**
   - Download and install the VIA Configurator from the official website (https://caniusevia.com/). Open the VIA Configurator, and your Corne keyboard should be automatically detected. You can now customize your keymap, layers, and other settings using the VIA Configurator interface.

8. **Save Your Configuration:**
   - Click the "Save" button in the VIA Configurator to save your configuration to the keyboard's EEPROM.

Your Corne keyboard is now flashed and configured with VIA. Enjoy your newly customized keyboard!
