### My Answer:

In the case of a 19-year-old presenting with mild chest and stomach pains, the following steps should be considered:

1. **Detailed History**:
   - **Symptom Analysis**: Ask about the onset, duration, and nature of the pain (sharp, dull, burning, etc.). Inquire about any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, or changes in bowel habits.
   - **Medication Use**: Confirm the dosage and frequency of acetaminophen and antacids. Ask about any other medications or supplements.
   - **Lifestyle Factors**: Assess diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, and stress levels.
   - **Medical History**: Review past medical history, family history of gastrointestinal or cardiac issues, and any recent illnesses or stressors.

2. **Vital Signs**:
   - Check blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature to rule out any immediate concerns.

3. **Physical Examination**:
   - **Cardiac Exam**: Listen to heart sounds to rule out any cardiac causes.
   - **Respiratory Exam**: Listen to lung sounds to rule out respiratory causes.
   - **Abdominal Exam**: Palpate the abdomen for tenderness, masses, or organomegaly. Check for signs of rebound tenderness or guarding.

4. **Initial Diagnostic Tests**:
   - **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To rule out cardiac causes of chest pain.
   - **Blood Tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), and possibly a Helicobacter pylori test if peptic ulcer disease is suspected.
   - **Imaging**: Consider an abdominal ultrasound or chest X-ray if indicated by the physical exam.

5. **Management**:
   - **Symptomatic Relief**: Continue with acetaminophen for pain but ensure the dosage is within safe limits. Consider a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker if GERD or gastritis is suspected.
   - **Lifestyle Modifications**: Advise on dietary changes such as avoiding spicy, fatty, or acidic foods. Recommend stress management techniques and regular physical activity.

6. **Patient Education**:
   - Educate the patient on the potential causes of their symptoms and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.
   - Discuss the risks of overusing over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen and antacids.

7. **Follow-Up**:
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment to reassess symptoms and review test results. Adjust the treatment plan as necessary based on findings.

8. **Referral**:
   - If symptoms persist or worsen, consider referring the patient to a gastroenterologist or cardiologist for further evaluation.
