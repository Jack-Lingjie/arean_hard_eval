To retrieve the current selection as plain text and the cursor position before the selection in a `QTextEdit` using PySide6, you can use the following code:

```python
import sys
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QTextEdit, QVBoxLayout, QPushButton, QWidget

class TextEditDemo(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.text_edit = QTextEdit()
        self.get_selection_button = QPushButton("Get Selection and Cursor Position")

        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.text_edit)
        layout.addWidget(self.get_selection_button)

        self.setLayout(layout)

        self.get_selection_button.clicked.connect(self.get_selection)

    def get_selection(self):
        cursor = self.text_edit.textCursor()
        selected_text = cursor.selectedText()
        cursor_position_before_selection = cursor.selectionStart()

        print("Selected Text:", selected_text)
        print("Cursor Position Before Selection:", cursor_position_before_selection)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    demo = TextEditDemo()
    demo.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec())
```

This code creates a simple PySide6 application with a `QTextEdit` and a `QPushButton`. When you click the button, it will print the current selection as plain text and the cursor position before the selection in the `QTextEdit`.

### Explanation:
1. **QTextEdit**: A widget that allows the user to edit and display both plain and rich text.
2. **QPushButton**: A button widget that the user can click to trigger an action.
3. **QVBoxLayout**: A layout manager that arranges widgets vertically.
4. **textCursor()**: Returns the cursor object for the text edit.
5. **selectedText()**: Returns the currently selected text.
6. **selectionStart()**: Returns the position of the start of the selection.

### Key Points:
- The `textCursor().selectedText()` method retrieves the selected text.
- The `textCursor().selectionStart()` method retrieves the cursor position before the selection.

This approach ensures that you get both the selected text and the cursor position before the selection accurately.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
Assistant A's answer is correct and provides a complete, working example that meets the user's requirements. The code is well-structured and includes all necessary components to create a PySide6 application that retrieves the current selection and cursor position before the selection.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
Assistant B's answer contains several inaccuracies and incomplete information:
1. The `toPlainText()` method retrieves the entire text in the `QTextEdit`, not the selected text.
2. The `textCursor().position()` method retrieves the current cursor position, not the position before the selection.
3. The example provided does not correctly implement the retrieval of the selected text and the cursor position before the selection.

### Verdict:
Assistant A's answer is significantly better because it provides a correct and complete solution, while Assistant B's answer contains inaccuracies and does not meet the user's requirements.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
