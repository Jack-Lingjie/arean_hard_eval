To address the user prompt, which asks for an example of a blocking read interrupted by a signal with EINTR handling, here is a suitable response:

### Example in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

// Signal handler function
void handle_signal(int sig) {
    printf("Signal %d received\n", sig);
}

int main() {
    // Set up the signal handler for SIGINT
    struct sigaction sa;
    sa.sa_handler = handle_signal;
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_flags = 0;
    if (sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL) == -1) {
        perror("sigaction");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Create a pipe
    int pipefd[2];
    if (pipe(pipefd) == -1) {
        perror("pipe");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    char buffer[1024];
    ssize_t bytes_read;

    while (1) {
        printf("Waiting for data...\n");
        bytes_read = read(pipefd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        if (bytes_read == -1) {
            if (errno == EINTR) {
                printf("Read interrupted by signal\n");
                continue; // Retry the read operation
            } else {
                perror("read");
                break;
            }
        } else if (bytes_read == 0) {
            // End of file
            printf("No more data\n");
            break;
        } else {
            printf("Read %zd bytes: %.*s\n", bytes_read, (int)bytes_read, buffer);
        }
    }

    close(pipefd[0]);
    close(pipefd[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Signal Handling**: The `handle_signal` function is set up to handle the `SIGINT` signal. This allows the program to catch and handle the signal when it's delivered.
2. **Pipe Creation**: A pipe is created using the `pipe` function, which provides a file descriptor for reading and writing.
3. **Blocking Read**: The `read` function is used to perform a blocking read on the pipe's read end.
4. **EINTR Handling**: If the read operation is interrupted by a signal (`errno == EINTR`), the read operation is retried.
5. **Error Handling**: Other potential errors during the read operation are handled appropriately, and the program exits if an unexpected error occurs.

### Evaluation of Assistant A and B

**Assistant A's Answer:**

- **Correctness**: The example provided is in Python, which is not incorrect but not as typical for demonstrating low-level EINTR handling as C.
- **Relevance**: The example is relevant but uses a higher-level language.
- **Conciseness**: The explanation is clear but slightly verbose.
- **Missing Information**: The example does not use `errno` directly, which is more common in C for EINTR handling.

**Assistant B's Answer:**

- **Correctness**: The example is in C, which is more appropriate for demonstrating EINTR handling.
- **Relevance**: The example is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt.
- **Conciseness**: The explanation is clear and to the point.
- **Missing Information**: The example uses `fread` instead of `read`, which is less typical for demonstrating EINTR handling.

**Final Verdict:**

Assistant B's answer is more appropriate because it uses C, which is more common for demonstrating EINTR handling. However, it should use `read` instead of `fread` for a more typical example. Despite this, Assistant B's answer is still more aligned with the prompt's requirements.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
