To securely expose a Jellyfin server to the public internet using Tailscale, follow these steps:

1. **Install Tailscale**:
   - On your Jellyfin server and the devices you want to access it from, install Tailscale. Tailscale is available for various platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. You can download the appropriate version from [Tailscale's download page](https://tailscale.com/download) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Set Up Tailscale on the Jellyfin Server**:
   - Sign in to your Tailscale account or create a new one if you don't have one.
   - Run the Tailscale client on your Jellyfin server and sign in with your Tailscale account.
   - Once connected, Tailscale will assign a unique IP address to your Jellyfin server. Note down this IP address.

3. **Configure Jellyfin to Allow Connections from Tailscale**:
   - Open the Jellyfin web interface on your server by navigating to `http://localhost:8096` in a web browser.
   - Sign in to your Jellyfin account and go to the Dashboard.
   - Click on "Networking" under the "Advanced" section.
   - In the "Local network addresses" field, add the Tailscale IP address you noted down earlier. This will allow Tailscale connections to access your Jellyfin server.
   - Save the changes and restart your Jellyfin server.

4. **Set Up Tailscale on the Devices You Want to Access Your Jellyfin Server From**:
   - Install the Tailscale client on your devices and sign in with your Tailscale account.
   - Once connected, your devices will be able to access the Jellyfin server using the Tailscale IP address.

5. **Access Your Jellyfin Server**:
   - On your devices, open a web browser and navigate to `http://[Tailscale_IP]:8096`, replacing `[Tailscale_IP]` with the Tailscale IP address of your Jellyfin server.
   - Sign in to your Jellyfin account and enjoy your media content securely over the public internet.

By using Tailscale, you create a secure, encrypted connection between your Jellyfin server and your devices, ensuring that your media content is only accessible to authorized users.
