### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:

**Strengths:**
1. Detailed breakdown of topics and hours.
2. Clear progression from beginner to advanced levels.
3. Inclusion of hands-on practice at each level.

**Weaknesses:**
1. Some redundancy in topic names (e.g., "CodeQL for specific languages" and "CodeQL for additional languages").
2. Could benefit from a more structured format (e.g., prerequisites, target audience).

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:

**Strengths:**
1. Well-structured format with clear sections.
2. Inclusion of course format, prerequisites, target audience, and support.
3. Comprehensive coverage of topics.

**Weaknesses:**
1. Less detailed breakdown of specific topics compared to Assistant A.
2. Fewer hours allocated to beginner and intermediate levels, which might be insufficient for thorough learning.

### Final Verdict:

While both answers are strong, Assistant A provides a more detailed and comprehensive breakdown of topics and hours, which is crucial for a technical course like CodeQL. Assistant B's answer is well-structured but lacks the depth in topic breakdown.

**Final Verdict: [[A>B]]**
