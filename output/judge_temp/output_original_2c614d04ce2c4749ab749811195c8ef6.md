**Medical Description of an Inflamed Joint:**
An inflamed joint, medically known as arthritis or arthralgia, is characterized by swelling, redness, warmth, and pain in the joint. This inflammation is typically a result of the body's immune response to injury, infection, or other underlying conditions.

**Presentation:**
- **Swelling:** The joint may appear enlarged due to fluid accumulation or inflammation of surrounding tissues.
- **Redness:** The skin over the joint may appear red or flushed due to increased blood flow.
- **Warmth:** The joint may feel warm to the touch, indicating increased blood flow.
- **Pain:** The joint may be painful, with pain levels ranging from mild to severe, often worsening with movement or pressure.
- **Stiffness:** The joint may feel stiff, especially after periods of inactivity.
- **Decreased Range of Motion:** Movement of the joint may be limited due to pain and swelling.

**Emergency Referral Criteria:**
- **Severe Pain:** Pain that is not relieved by over-the-counter medications.
- **Sudden Onset:** Rapid development of swelling, redness, and warmth, especially if accompanied by fever or chills, which may indicate an infection.
- **Immobility:** Inability to move the joint or bear weight on it.
- **Circulatory Issues:** Signs of poor blood circulation, such as cold, pale, or blue skin around the joint.
- **Recent Trauma:** History of recent injury to the joint.
- **Underlying Conditions:** Presence of conditions like diabetes or a weakened immune system that may increase the risk of complications.

**Common Causes:**
- **Osteoarthritis:** Degeneration of joint cartilage over time.
- **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks joint linings.
- **Gout:** Accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joint.
- **Infections:** Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, such as septic arthritis or Lyme disease.
