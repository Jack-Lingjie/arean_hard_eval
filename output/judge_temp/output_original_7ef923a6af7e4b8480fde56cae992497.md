To solve the problem, we need to break it down into two parts: 

a. Finding the value of the annuity 6 years from now.
b. Finding the current value of the annuity.

### Part a: Value of the Annuity 6 Years from Now

1. **Convert the annual discount rate to a monthly rate:**
   \[
   r_{\text{monthly}} = \frac{13\%}{12} = 0.0108333
   \]

2. **Convert the monthly rate to a semiannual rate:**
   \[
   (1 + r_{\text{semiannual}}) = (1 + r_{\text{monthly}})^{6}
   \]
   \[
   (1 + r_{\text{semiannual}}) = (1 + 0.0108333)^{6} \approx 1.06768
   \]
   \[
   r_{\text{semiannual}} \approx 0.06768
   \]

3. **Calculate the present value of the annuity at the time it starts (12 years from now):**
   \[
   PV = P \times \left(1 - (1 + r)^{-n}\right) / r
   \]
   Where:
   - \( P = 7000 \)
   - \( r = 0.06768 \)
   - \( n = 40 \) (since there are 40 semiannual payments)

   \[
   PV = 7000 \times \left(1 - (1 + 0.06768)^{-40}\right) / 0.06768
   \]
   \[
   PV \approx 7000 \times 13.528 \approx 94700
   \]

4. **Discount this value back to 6 years from now:**
   \[
   PV_{\text{6 years from now}} = PV_{\text{12 years from now}} / (1 + r_{\text{semiannual}})^{12}
   \]
   \[
   PV_{\text{6 years from now}} = 94700 / (1.06768)^{12} \approx 94700 / 2.105 \approx 44980
   \]

### Part b: Current Value of the Annuity

1. **Discount the value 6 years from now back to the present:**
   \[
   PV_{\text{current}} = PV_{\text{6 years from now}} / (1 + r_{\text{semiannual}})^{12}
   \]
   \[
   PV_{\text{current}} = 44980 / (1.06768)^{12} \approx 44980 / 2.105 \approx 21370
   \]

So, the value of the annuity 6 years from now is approximately $44,980, and the current value of the annuity is approximately $21,370.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer

1. **Correct Approach:**
   - Assistant A correctly identifies the need to convert the annual discount rate to a monthly rate and then to a semiannual rate.
   - The annuity formula is used correctly to find the present value at the start of the annuity.

2. **Errors:**
   - The calculation of the semiannual rate is slightly off.
   - The final present value calculations are incorrect.

3. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - The explanation is clear but contains calculation errors.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer

1. **Correct Approach:**
   - Assistant B outlines the steps needed to solve the problem but does not provide the actual calculations.
   - The approach is correct but incomplete.

2. **Errors:**
   - The final answer is not provided correctly.
   - The steps are not fully executed, leading to an incomplete solution.

3. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - The explanation is clear but lacks the necessary calculations and final answer.

### Final Verdict

Assistant A provides a more complete and detailed response, despite some calculation errors. Assistant B's response is incomplete and does not provide a final answer.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
