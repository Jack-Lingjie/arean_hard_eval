To determine the time after waiting for 1.65 hours from 1:00 AM, follow these steps:

1. Convert 1.65 hours into hours and minutes:
   - 1.65 hours is 1 hour and 0.65 hours.
   - 0.65 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 39 minutes.

2. Add the converted time to the current time:
   - Start time: 1:00 AM.
   - Wait time: 1 hour and 39 minutes.

3. Calculate the final time:
   - 1:00 AM + 1 hour = 2:00 AM.
   - 2:00 AM + 39 minutes = 2:39 AM.

Therefore, after waiting for 1.65 hours, it will be 2:39 AM.
