### My Answer

To query an Excel table using MySQL, you first need to import the Excel data into a MySQL database. Here are the steps and the SQL query to achieve the desired result:

1. **Import Excel Data into MySQL**:
   - Use a tool like MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or a script to import the Excel data into a MySQL table. Assume the table is named `tree_data` with columns `tree_species`, `diameter_class`, and `volume`.

2. **SQL Query**:
   - Once the data is imported, you can use the following SQL query to select tree species by diameter class, count the number of representations of the diameter class, and sum the volume of the total:

```sql
SELECT
  tree_species,
  diameter_class,
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  SUM(volume) AS total_volume
FROM
  tree_data
GROUP BY
  tree_species,
  diameter_class
ORDER BY
  tree_species,
  diameter_class;
```

This query groups the data by `tree_species` and `diameter_class`, counts the number of rows in each group, and sums the `volume` column for each group. The result is ordered by `tree_species` and `diameter_class`.
