**My Answer:**

**Goal 1: Develop a Comprehensive IT Incident Response Plan**

- **Specific**: Create a detailed IT Incident Response Plan that includes steps for handling security breaches, system failures, and other IT incidents. The plan should outline roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and recovery procedures.
- **Measurable**: The plan will be considered complete when it has been reviewed and approved by the IT Steering Committee and other relevant stakeholders.
- **Achievable**: Collaborate with IT team members, department heads, and external consultants to gather input and ensure the plan addresses all potential risks and scenarios.
- **Relevant**: A well-defined Incident Response Plan will help the organization minimize the impact of IT incidents, protect sensitive data, and maintain business continuity.
- **Time-bound**: Complete the development of the IT Incident Response Plan within the first 3 months.

**Goal 2: Conduct Tabletop Exercises to Test the Incident Response Plan**

- **Specific**: Organize and facilitate a series of tabletop exercises to test the effectiveness of the IT Incident Response Plan, identify gaps, and refine the plan as needed.
- **Measurable**: Conduct at least 3 tabletop exercises, each focusing on a different incident scenario, with participation from all relevant stakeholders.
- **Achievable**: Coordinate with IT team members and department heads to schedule the exercises and ensure all participants are prepared and engaged.
- **Relevant**: Tabletop exercises will help validate the Incident Response Plan and improve the organization's ability to respond effectively to IT incidents.
- **Time-bound**: Complete all 3 tabletop exercises within the next 3 months, following the completion of the Incident Response Plan.

**Goal 3: Implement Continuous Improvement and Training**

- **Specific**: Establish a process for continuous improvement of the IT Incident Response Plan, incorporating lessons learned from tabletop exercises and real-world incidents, and provide ongoing training for all relevant stakeholders.
- **Measurable**: Update the Incident Response Plan at least twice per year, and conduct annual refresher training for all stakeholders.
- **Achievable**: Assign a dedicated team member to oversee the continuous improvement process and coordinate training efforts.
- **Relevant**: Regular updates and training will ensure the Incident Response Plan remains effective and relevant, and that all stakeholders are prepared to respond to IT incidents.
- **Time-bound**: Begin the continuous improvement process and schedule the first round of refresher training within 6 months of completing the tabletop exercises.
