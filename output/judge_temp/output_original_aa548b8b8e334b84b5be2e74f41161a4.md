### My Answer:

**Step 1: Determine the legs of a QQQ bear put spread for a particular expiry date and strike price spreads.**

A bear put spread involves:
- Buying a put option with a higher strike price.
- Selling a put option with a lower strike price.
Both options have the same expiration date.

For example:
- Underlying: QQQ
- Expiry date: 30 days from now
- Strike price of the long put: $350
- Strike price of the short put: $340

So, the bear put spread would involve:
1. Buying a $350 put option on QQQ with a 30-day expiry.
2. Selling a $340 put option on QQQ with the same 30-day expiry.

**Step 2: Determine the legs of a SHORT QQQ bull put spread for the same expiry dates and strike price points.**

A bull put spread involves:
- Selling a put option with a higher strike price.
- Buying a put option with a lower strike price.
Both options have the same expiration date.

To short a bull put spread, you would reverse the positions:
1. Buying a $340 put option on QQQ with a 30-day expiry.
2. Selling a $350 put option on QQQ with the same 30-day expiry.

**Step 3: Compare the LONG bear put spread and SHORT bull put spread positions.**

Comparing the two positions:
- LONG bear put spread: Buy $350 put, sell $340 put.
- SHORT bull put spread: Sell $350 put, buy $340 put.

**Conclusion:**

A LONG bear put spread and a SHORT bull put spread with the same duration and strike price points are indeed the same position. They are synthetically equivalent because they involve the same options but in opposite directions.
