To determine how many 400-watt solar panels are needed in Michigan to produce the same amount of power in a day as an EV car that drives 40 miles a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily energy consumption of the EV:**
   - The car drives 40 miles per day.
   - The car uses 0.3 kWh per mile.
   - Daily energy consumption = 40 miles * 0.3 kWh/mile = 12 kWh/day.

2. **Calculate the daily energy production of one 400-watt solar panel:**
   - The solar panel operates at 400 watts.
   - Michigan averages 4 peak sun hours per day.
   - Daily energy production per panel = 400 watts * 4 hours = 1600 watt-hours or 1.6 kWh/day.

3. **Determine the number of solar panels needed:**
   - Total energy needed = 12 kWh/day.
   - Energy production per panel = 1.6 kWh/day.
   - Number of panels needed = 12 kWh/day / 1.6 kWh/day = 7.5 panels.

Since you cannot have a fraction of a solar panel, you would need 8 solar panels to meet the daily energy needs of the EV.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Correctly calculates the daily energy consumption of the EV.
- Correctly calculates the daily energy production of one solar panel.
- Correctly determines the number of solar panels needed and rounds up to 8 panels.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Correctly calculates the daily energy consumption of the EV.
- Correctly calculates the daily energy production of one solar panel.
- Correctly determines the number of solar panels needed and rounds up to 8 panels.

Both assistants provided accurate and clear responses. They both followed the same logical steps and arrived at the correct conclusion. There are no significant differences in the quality, relevance, or conciseness of their answers.

My final verdict is tie: [[A=B]].
