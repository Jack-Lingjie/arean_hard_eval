Here is my own answer to the prompt:

```sql
-- This query retrieves and aggregates data from the PATIENT_INFO table.
-- It calculates the average number of service lines used and the count of distinct patients
-- for each combination of region and subregion.

SELECT 
  IFNULL(region, '') AS region, -- Replace NULL values in the region column with an empty string
  IFNULL(subregion, '') AS subregion, -- Replace NULL values in the subregion column with an empty string
  AVG(COUNT_SERVICE_LINES_USED) AS avg_ct_sl, -- Calculate the average number of service lines used
  COUNT(DISTINCT patientid) AS ct_patients -- Count the number of distinct patients

FROM PATIENT_INFO -- Source table

GROUP BY CUBE(1, 2) -- Group by all combinations of region and subregion

ORDER BY avg_ct_sl DESC; -- Order the results by the average number of service lines used in descending order
```

**Key Points:**
- **IFNULL Function**: Replaces NULL values with a specified string ('' in this case).
- **AVG Function**: Calculates the average of a numeric column (COUNT_SERVICE_LINES_USED).
- **COUNT(DISTINCT) Function**: Counts the number of unique values in a column (patientid).
- **CUBE Function**: Generates a group by clause that includes all possible combinations of the specified columns (region and subregion).
- **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts the results in descending order based on the avg_ct_sl column.
