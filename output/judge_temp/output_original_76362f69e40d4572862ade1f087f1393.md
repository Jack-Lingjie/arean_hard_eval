To address the user's prompt on how to have multiple websites point to different domains but serve from the same database with different user interface templates, here is a comprehensive answer:

### Solution Overview

You can achieve this by setting up a multi-tenant architecture where each domain points to the same backend but uses different templates based on the domain accessed. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Steps to Implement

1. **Set Up Your Main Website and Database:**
   - Create your main website and set up a centralized database that will serve content to all the other websites.

2. **Create Multiple User Interface Templates:**
   - Design different user interface templates for each of your websites. These templates will determine the look and feel of each website but will all pull data from the same database.

3. **Configure Your Web Server:**
   - Depending on the web server you are using (e.g., Apache, Nginx), configure it to handle multiple domains. This usually involves creating virtual hosts or server blocks for each domain, pointing them to the same document root where your main website files are located.

4. **Implement Domain-Based Template Selection:**
   - In your main website's code, add logic to detect the domain being accessed and load the appropriate user interface template based on the domain. This can be done using server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js.

5. **Register and Configure Additional Domains:**
   - Register the additional domains you want to use and configure their DNS settings to point to the same web server as your main website.

6. **Test Your Setup:**
   - Access each of your domains in a web browser to ensure they are loading the correct user interface template and pulling data from the same database.

### Example Implementation in PHP

Here’s a simple example using PHP to load different templates based on the domain:

```php
// Determine the current domain
$domain = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];

// Load the correct template based on the domain
if ($domain == 'example1.com') {
    include 'template1.php';
} elseif ($domain == 'example2.com') {
    include 'template2.php';
} else {
    include 'default_template.php';
}
```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can have multiple websites with different domains, each displaying a unique user interface but all served from the same database. This approach ensures that you maintain a single source of truth for your data while providing a customized experience for each domain.
