To generate edge test cases for the condition `FICO > 750 && FICO <= 900 AND N_INQ < 2`, we need to consider the boundary values and just outside the boundary values for both FICO scores and the number of inquiries (N_INQ). Here are the edge test cases:

1. **FICO = 750, N_INQ = 1**
   - Input: FICO = 750, N_INQ = 1
   - Expected Output: Condition is False (FICO is not greater than 750)

2. **FICO = 751, N_INQ = 1**
   - Input: FICO = 751, N_INQ = 1
   - Expected Output: Condition is True (FICO is greater than 750 and less than or equal to 900, N_INQ is less than 2)

3. **FICO = 900, N_INQ = 1**
   - Input: FICO = 900, N_INQ = 1
   - Expected Output: Condition is True (FICO is greater than 750 and less than or equal to 900, N_INQ is less than 2)

4. **FICO = 901, N_INQ = 1**
   - Input: FICO = 901, N_INQ = 1
   - Expected Output: Condition is False (FICO is greater than 900)

5. **FICO = 751, N_INQ = 2**
   - Input: FICO = 751, N_INQ = 2
   - Expected Output: Condition is False (N_INQ is not less than 2)

6. **FICO = 751, N_INQ = 0**
   - Input: FICO = 751, N_INQ = 0
   - Expected Output: Condition is True (FICO is greater than 750 and less than or equal to 900, N_INQ is less than 2)

7. **FICO = 900, N_INQ = 0**
   - Input: FICO = 900, N_INQ = 0
   - Expected Output: Condition is True (FICO is greater than 750 and less than or equal to 900, N_INQ is less than 2)

8. **FICO = 900, N_INQ = 2**
   - Input: FICO = 900, N_INQ = 2
   - Expected Output: Condition is False (N_INQ is not less than 2)

9. **FICO = 750, N_INQ = 0**
   - Input: FICO = 750, N_INQ = 0
   - Expected Output: Condition is False (FICO is not greater than 750)

10. **FICO = 751, N_INQ = 1**
    - Input: FICO = 751, N_INQ = 1
    - Expected Output: Condition is True (FICO is greater than 750 and less than or equal to 900, N_INQ is less than 2)

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: Assistant A's answer is mostly correct but has a mistake in Test Case 3 and Test Case 9. For Test Case 3, FICO = 900 should be True, and for Test Case 9, FICO = 900 should be True.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful as it provides specific test cases with expected outputs.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: Assistant B's answer has a mistake in Test Case 5 and Test Case 6. For Test Case 5, FICO = 900 should be True, and for Test Case 6, FICO = 750 should be False.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful but less specific in terms of edge cases compared to Assistant A.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is somewhat verbose and could be more concise.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A's answer is more specific and concise, despite the minor mistakes. Assistant B's answer is more verbose and less focused on edge cases.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
