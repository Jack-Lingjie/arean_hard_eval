To classify customers as "new" or "existing" based on their purchase history in the previous 6 weeks, you can use a combination of window functions and self-joins. Here is an example SQL code to achieve this:

```sql
WITH previous_purchases AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    basket_key,
    week,
    LAG(week, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, basket_key ORDER BY week) AS previous_week
  FROM
    sales
),
classified_customers AS (
  SELECT
    a.customer_id,
    a.basket_key,
    a.week,
    CASE
      WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM previous_purchases b
        WHERE a.customer_id = b.customer_id
          AND a.basket_key = b.basket_key
          AND b.week BETWEEN a.week - 6 AND a.week - 1
      ) THEN 'existing'
      ELSE 'new'
    END AS customer_type
  FROM
    sales a
)

SELECT
  customer_id,
  basket_key,
  week,
  customer_type
FROM
  classified_customers
ORDER BY
  customer_id,
  week;
```

### Explanation:

1. **`previous_purchases` CTE**:
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the previous week a customer purchased a product using the `LAG` window function.

2. **`classified_customers` CTE**:
   - This CTE classifies customers as "new" or "existing" based on their purchase history in the previous 6 weeks.
   - It uses a `CASE` statement with an `EXISTS` subquery to check if there are any purchases of the same product by the same customer in the previous 6 weeks.

3. **Final Query**:
   - The final query selects the `customer_id`, `basket_key`, `week`, and `customer_type` from the `classified_customers` CTE and orders the result by `customer_id` and `week`.

This approach ensures that each customer's purchase history is evaluated correctly, and they are classified as "new" or "existing" based on their activity in the previous 6 weeks.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The approach uses a self-join and a `ROW_NUMBER` window function to classify customers. However, the logic for determining "new" or "existing" is not entirely clear and might not correctly handle the 6-week window.
2. **Helpfulness**: The explanation is somewhat helpful but lacks clarity on how the 6-week window is applied.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt but could be more precise.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise but might be overly complex for the task.

### Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The approach uses a window function to count distinct weeks within a 6-week window. However, it incorrectly classifies customers based on the count of distinct weeks rather than checking for purchases in the previous 6 weeks.
2. **Helpfulness**: The explanation is detailed and provides an example, but the logic is flawed.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant but does not correctly address the prompt's requirements.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is clear but includes unnecessary details.

### Verdict:
Both responses have issues with the correctness of their logic. However, Assistant B provides a more detailed explanation and an example, which makes it slightly more helpful despite the incorrect logic.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
