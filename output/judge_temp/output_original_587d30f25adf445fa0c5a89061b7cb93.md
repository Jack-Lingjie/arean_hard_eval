To shape a high hydration whole wheat baguette, follow these steps:

### Preparation

1. **Mix the Dough**: Combine whole wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl. Mix until the dough comes together into a shaggy mass.
2. **Autolyse**: Let the dough rest for 20-30 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the water, which helps develop the dough's structure.
3. **Knead**: Knead the dough for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or knead by hand.

### Shaping

1. **Bulk Fermentation**: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it ferment in a warm, draft-free area for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
2. **Divide the Dough**: Gently deflate the dough and divide it into equal pieces, depending on the number of baguettes you want to make. Use a bench scraper or a sharp knife to divide the dough.
3. **Pre-shape**: Shape each portion into a loose ball by folding the edges towards the center and pinching them together. Let the dough balls rest for 20-30 minutes, covered with a damp cloth or plastic wrap.
4. **Final Shaping**: Lightly flour the top of the dough ball and flip it over, so the floured side is facing down. Gently press the dough into a rough rectangle, with the long side facing you. Fold the top third of the dough down towards the center and press gently to seal. Fold the bottom third up towards the center and press gently to seal. Now, fold the dough in half lengthwise, pinching the seam together to create a tight seal.
5. **Roll and Elongate**: Starting from the center of the dough, use your hands to gently roll the dough back and forth, applying light pressure and working your way towards the ends. This will help elongate the dough into a baguette shape. Make sure to taper the ends slightly to create the classic baguette point.

### Proofing

1. **Transfer to a Couche or Baking Sheet**: Place the shaped baguette onto a well-floured linen couche (a cloth used for proofing bread) or a parchment-lined baking sheet, seam side down. If using a couche, make sure to create folds between each baguette to support their shape during the final proof.
2. **Final Proof**: Cover the shaped baguettes with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let them proof for 45-60 minutes, or until they have increased in size by about 50%.

### Baking

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C) with a baking stone or steel inside, if you have one. Place a pan with water on the bottom rack to create steam during baking.
2. **Score and Bake**: Transfer the proofed baguettes onto a baking peel or the back of a baking sheet, seam side down. Use a sharp knife or a lame (a special baker's blade) to make 3-4 diagonal slashes along the length of each baguette. Slide the baguettes onto the preheated baking stone or directly onto the oven rack. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 205째F (96째C).

### Cooling

1. **Cool**: Remove the baguettes from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing and enjoying.

### Tips

- **Practice**: The more you work with high hydration dough, the better you'll become at shaping whole wheat baguettes.
- **Hydration**: High hydration doughs can be sticky and challenging to work with, so keep your hands and work surface lightly floured to prevent sticking.

By following these steps, you should be able to shape a beautiful, high-hydration whole wheat baguette.
