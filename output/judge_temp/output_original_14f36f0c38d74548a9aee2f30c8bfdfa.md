To access the last many2many field ID in Odoo, you can use the following approach:

1. **Direct Access from the Record**:
   If you have a record and you want to access the last ID in its many2many field, you can directly access the field and get the last element. Here is a code snippet:

   ```python
   # Assuming you have a many2many field named 'your_many2many_field' in your model
   last_id = your_record.your_many2many_field[-1].id if your_record.your_many2many_field else None
   ```

   Replace `your_record` with the record you are working on and `your_many2many_field` with the name of the many2many field you want to access. This code will give you the last ID in the many2many field if there are any records, otherwise, it will return `None`.

2. **Using the `search` Method**:
   If you need to find the last ID across all records of a many2many model, you can use the `search` method with ordering:

   ```python
   last_id = self.env['many2many_model'].search([], order='id desc', limit=1).id
   ```

   Replace `many2many_model` with the actual model name of the many2many field.

3. **Example Use Case**:
   Suppose you have a model `res.partner` and a many2many field `product_ids` referencing `product.product`. You can use the above methods to get the last added product ID:

   ```python
   partner = self.env['res.partner'].browse(self.env.context.get('active_id'))
   last_product_id = partner.product_ids[-1].id if partner.product_ids else None
   ```

This approach ensures you can access the last many2many field ID either directly from a record or by searching the model.
