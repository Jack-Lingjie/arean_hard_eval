To compute the n-th Fibonacci number mod p in JavaScript, we can use two different approaches: iterative and matrix exponentiation. Here is a solution using both methods:

### Iterative Approach
This approach uses a simple loop to compute the Fibonacci numbers up to the n-th number and takes the result modulo p.

```javascript
function fibonacciModN(n, p) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }

  let prev = 0;
  let curr = 1;

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    let temp = (curr + prev) % p;
    prev = curr;
    curr = temp;
  }

  return curr;
}

// Example usage:
let n = 10;
let p = 5;
console.log(`The ${n}-th Fibonacci number mod ${p} is: ${fibonacciModN(n, p)}`);
```

### Matrix Exponentiation Approach
This approach uses matrix exponentiation to compute the Fibonacci numbers more efficiently, especially for large n.

```javascript
function fibonacciMod(n, p) {
  if (n === 0) return 0;
  if (n === 1) return 1;

  const matrix = [
    [1, 1],
    [1, 0]
  ];

  const result = matrixPower(matrix, n - 1, p);
  return result[0][0] % p;
}

function matrixMultiply(a, b, p) {
  const result = [
    [0, 0],
    [0, 0]
  ];

  for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      for (let k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
        result[i][j] = (result[i][j] + a[i][k] * b[k][j]) % p;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}

function matrixPower(matrix, n, p) {
  if (n === 0) return [[1, 0], [0, 1]];

  const halfPower = matrixPower(matrix, Math.floor(n / 2), p);
  const result = matrixMultiply(halfPower, halfPower, p);

  if (n % 2 === 1) {
    return matrixMultiply(result, matrix, p);
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(fibonacciMod(10, 100)); // Output: 55
console.log(fibonacciMod(20, 1000)); // Output: 676
```

### Evaluation of the Assistants' Answers

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Uses an iterative approach.
- The code is correct and straightforward.
- It is efficient for small to moderately large values of n.
- The explanation is clear and includes an example usage.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Uses the matrix exponentiation method.
- The code is correct and more efficient for very large values of n.
- The explanation is detailed and includes example usage.
- There is a minor mistake in the `matrixPower` function where the matrix multiplication for odd n is not correctly implemented. It should return `matrixMultiply(result, matrix, p)` instead of manually adding matrix elements.

### Conclusion
Both answers are correct and useful, but Assistant B's answer is more efficient for large values of n due to the matrix exponentiation method. However, the minor mistake in the matrix exponentiation implementation needs to be corrected.

Given the overall quality and efficiency of the solution, I would rate:

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant B is slightly better: [[B>A]]
