To determine if a number is odd in Scheme, you can write a function that checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, the number is odd. Here is a simple Scheme program to achieve this:

```scheme
(define (is-odd? n)
  (= (modulo n 2) 1))

; Test cases
(display (is-odd? 3)) ; should display #t (true)
(newline)
(display (is-odd? 4)) ; should display #f (false)
(newline)
```

This program defines a function `is-odd?` that takes a single argument `n`. It uses the `modulo` function to find the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, the function returns `#t` (true), indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `#f` (false). The test cases demonstrate the usage of the function.

### Explanation:
- **`define`**: Used to define a function.
- **`is-odd?`**: The name of the function, with a question mark to indicate it returns a boolean value.
- **`modulo`**: Calculates the remainder of the division of `n` by 2.
- **`=`**: Checks if the remainder is equal to 1.

### Running the Code:
To run this code, you need a Scheme interpreter such as DrRacket or Guile. Save the code in a file with a `.scm` extension and run it using your chosen interpreter.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The function correctly determines if a number is odd.
2. **Clarity**: The explanation is clear and concise.
3. **Test Cases**: Provides test cases to demonstrate the function.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.

### Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The function correctly determines if a number is odd.
2. **Clarity**: The explanation is detailed and clear.
3. **Test Cases**: Provides test cases to demonstrate the function.
4. **Additional Information**: Includes information on how to run the code and mentions popular Scheme interpreters.

### Comparison:
- Both assistants provide correct and clear solutions.
- Assistant B's answer is more detailed, including additional information on running the code and mentioning popular Scheme interpreters, which could be helpful for beginners.
- Assistant A's answer is more concise and directly addresses the prompt without additional context.

Given the prompt's simplicity, the additional information provided by Assistant B, while helpful, is not strictly necessary. However, it does add value for users who might be new to Scheme.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant B's answer is slightly better due to the additional helpful context provided.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
