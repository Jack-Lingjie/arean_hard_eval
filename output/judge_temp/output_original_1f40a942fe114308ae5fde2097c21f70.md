**A-Level Exam Question: Circular Motion**

**Question:**

A small object of mass 0.5 kg is attached to a string of length 1.5 m and is being swung in a horizontal circle at a constant speed. The tension in the string is 15 N. Calculate the angular velocity of the object and the time it takes to complete one full revolution.

**Mark Scheme:**

1. **Calculate the centripetal force acting on the object (1 mark)**
   - The centripetal force is provided by the tension in the string.
   - Answer: 15 N

2. **Calculate the linear velocity of the object (2 marks)**
   - Use the formula for centripetal force: \( F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} \)
   - Rearrange to solve for \( v \): \( v = \sqrt{\frac{F_c \cdot r}{m}} \)
   - Substitute the values: \( v = \sqrt{\frac{15 \, \text{N} \cdot 1.5 \, \text{m}}{0.5 \, \text{kg}}} = \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \, \text{m/s} \)

3. **Calculate the angular velocity of the object (2 marks)**
   - Use the formula: \( v = \omega \cdot r \)
   - Rearrange to solve for \( \omega \): \( \omega = \frac{v}{r} \)
   - Substitute the values: \( \omega = \frac{6.71 \, \text{m/s}}{1.5 \, \text{m}} \approx 4.47 \, \text{rad/s} \)

4. **Calculate the time period for one full revolution (2 marks)**
   - Use the formula: \( T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \)
   - Substitute the values: \( T = \frac{2\pi}{4.47 \, \text{rad/s}} \approx 1.41 \, \text{s} \)

**Answer:**

1. The centripetal force acting on the object is 15 N.
2. The linear velocity of the object is approximately 6.71 m/s.
3. The angular velocity of the object is approximately 4.47 rad/s.
4. The time it takes to complete one full revolution is approximately 1.41 seconds.
