Here is a simple implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using plain TypeScript. This implementation includes a basic forward pass with a single hidden layer and the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function.

```typescript
class RNN {
  inputSize: number;
  hiddenSize: number;
  outputSize: number;
  weightsInputHidden: number[][];
  weightsHiddenOutput: number[][];
  hiddenState: number[];

  constructor(inputSize: number, hiddenSize: number, outputSize: number) {
    this.inputSize = inputSize;
    this.hiddenSize = hiddenSize;
    this.outputSize = outputSize;

    this.weightsInputHidden = this.randomMatrix(hiddenSize, inputSize);
    this.weightsHiddenOutput = this.randomMatrix(outputSize, hiddenSize);
    this.hiddenState = new Array(hiddenSize).fill(0);
  }

  randomMatrix(rows: number, cols: number): number[][] {
    return Array.from({ length: rows }, () =>
      Array.from({ length: cols }, () => Math.random() * 2 - 1)
    );
  }

  tanh(x: number): number {
    return Math.tanh(x);
  }

  forward(input: number[]): number[] {
    const hidden = this.weightsInputHidden.map((row) =>
      row.reduce((sum, w, i) => sum + w * input[i], 0)
    );

    const hiddenActivated = hidden.map((h) => this.tanh(h));
    this.hiddenState = hiddenActivated;

    const output = this.weightsHiddenOutput.map((row) =>
      row.reduce((sum, w, i) => sum + w * hiddenActivated[i], 0)
    );

    return output;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const inputSize = 3;
const hiddenSize = 4;
const outputSize = 2;

const rnn = new RNN(inputSize, hiddenSize, outputSize);
const input = [1, 0, -1];
const output = rnn.forward(input);

console.log(output);
```

This implementation provides a basic forward pass for an RNN. To train the network, you would need to implement backpropagation through time (BPTT) or another optimization algorithm. Additionally, you may want to add support for more advanced activation functions and weight initialization techniques.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer

1. **Correctness**: The implementation provided by Assistant A is correct and includes the necessary components for a basic RNN forward pass.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response is helpful as it directly addresses the prompt and provides a working example.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt, focusing on a simple RNN implementation in TypeScript.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point, without unnecessary details.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer

1. **Correctness**: The implementation provided by Assistant B is also correct but includes additional components like a `Neuron` class and multiple activation functions, which are not strictly necessary for a simple RNN implementation.
2. **Helpfulness**: While the response is helpful, it is more complex than required by the prompt. The additional details might be useful for a more advanced implementation but are not necessary for a simple RNN.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant but includes extra information that might not be needed for a basic implementation.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is less concise due to the additional components and explanations.

### Final Verdict

Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the prompt's requirement for a simple RNN implementation in TypeScript. It is concise, relevant, and directly addresses the user's request without unnecessary complexity.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
