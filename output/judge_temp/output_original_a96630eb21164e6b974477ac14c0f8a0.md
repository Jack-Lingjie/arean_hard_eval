**Background of the Invention**

The present invention relates to a system for detecting undercurrent faults in heated grip applications for two-wheeled vehicles. Heated grips are essential for rider comfort, especially in cold weather conditions. The conventional systems for heated grips typically involve a Master Electronic Control Unit (ECU) that sends a command to a Slave ECU to initiate the heating process. The Slave ECU generates a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal to heat the coil and monitors the temperature sensor to regulate the heating.

In an ideal scenario, the hardware would include a provision to sense the actual current consumption of the heating coil. This information would be crucial for the microcontroller to determine whether an undercurrent fault has occurred. An undercurrent fault indicates that the coil is not drawing the expected amount of current, which could be due to a fault in the heating element or other issues.

However, the existing hardware setup lacks the capability to sense the current directly. Implementing current sensing hardware, such as current sensors or shunt resistors, would increase the cost and complexity of the system. These additional components could also introduce noise or interference in the PWM signal, potentially affecting the heating performance of the coil.

Existing solutions that use current sensors or shunt resistors to measure the actual current consumption and compare it with a threshold value are not ideal. These solutions require additional hardware components, which not only increase the cost but also complicate the system design. Moreover, the introduction of these components can lead to noise and interference issues, further degrading the performance of the heated grips.

Therefore, there is a need for an improved system that can detect undercurrent faults in heated grip applications without the need for additional current sensing hardware. Such a system should be cost-effective, efficient, and should not compromise the heating performance of the coil.
