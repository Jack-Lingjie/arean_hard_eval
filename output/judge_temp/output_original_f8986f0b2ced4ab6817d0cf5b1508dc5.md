To find the net force exerted on the point charge by the ring, we need to consider the symmetry and the electric field produced by the ring at its center.

1. **Convert the charges to Coulombs:**
   - \( Q = 275 \, \mu C = 275 \times 10^{-6} \, C \)
   - \( q = -75 \, \mu C = -75 \times 10^{-6} \, C \)

2. **Electric Field at the Center of the Ring:**
   For a uniformly charged ring, the electric field at the center is zero due to symmetry. The contributions from all the infinitesimal charge elements on the ring cancel out.

3. **Force Calculation:**
   Since the electric field at the center of a uniformly charged ring is zero, the net force exerted on a point charge placed at the center of the ring is also zero.

Therefore, the magnitude of the net force exerted on the point charge by the ring is:
\[ F = 0 \, N \]

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and Assistant B's Answers:

**Assistant A:**
- Incorrectly calculated the electric field at the center of the ring.
- Used an incorrect formula for the electric field.
- Provided a non-zero force value, which is incorrect.

**Assistant B:**
- Also incorrectly calculated the electric field at the center of the ring.
- Used an incorrect formula for the electric field.
- Provided a non-zero force value, which is incorrect.

Both assistants failed to recognize that the electric field at the center of a uniformly charged ring is zero due to symmetry, leading to a net force of zero on the point charge.

**Final Verdict:**
Both answers are incorrect, but Assistant B's answer is more detailed and shows a better understanding of the steps involved, even though the final conclusion is wrong.

My final verdict is tie: [[A=B]]
