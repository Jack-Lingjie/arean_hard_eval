To create a WordPress plugin that clears all Nginx Helper cache when a plugin or theme is added, updated, or changed, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create the Plugin Directory and File:**
   - Create a new folder in your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins` directory, and name it something like `clear-nginx-cache-on-update`.
   - Inside the new folder, create a PHP file with the same name as the folder, for example, `clear-nginx-cache-on-update.php`.

2. **Add the Plugin Header:**
   - Open the PHP file and add the following code to create the plugin header:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Clear Nginx Cache on Update
 * Plugin URI: https://www.example.com/
 * Description: This plugin clears the Nginx Helper cache when a plugin or theme is added, updated, or changed.
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * Author: Your Name
 * Author URI: https://www.example.com/
 * License: GPL-2.0+
 * License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt
 */
```

3. **Add the Cache Clearing Function:**
   - Add the function that will clear the Nginx Helper cache:

```php
function clear_nginx_cache_on_update() {
    if (function_exists('rt_nginx_helper_purge_all')) {
        rt_nginx_helper_purge_all();
    }
}
```

4. **Add WordPress Hooks:**
   - Add the WordPress hooks that will trigger the cache clearing function when a plugin or theme is added, updated, or changed:

```php
add_action('upgrader_process_complete', 'clear_nginx_cache_on_update', 10, 2);
add_action('switch_theme', 'clear_nginx_cache_on_update');
add_action('wp_update_nav_menu', 'clear_nginx_cache_on_update');
```

5. **Activate the Plugin:**
   - Save the file and close it.
   - Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard, go to the "Plugins" page, and activate the "Clear Nginx Cache on Update" plugin.

This plugin assumes you have the Nginx Helper plugin installed and activated. If you don't, the `function_exists('rt_nginx_helper_purge_all')` check will prevent any errors.

### Evaluation of Assistant A and B's Answers:

**Assistant A:**
- Provides a clear and concise step-by-step guide.
- Includes the necessary hooks and functions to clear the Nginx Helper cache.
- Assumes the presence of the Nginx Helper plugin and checks for the function's existence to prevent errors.

**Assistant B:**
- Provides a detailed description and installation instructions.
- Includes hooks and functions to clear the cache but uses a custom `clear_cache` function that assumes the cache is stored in a specific directory.
- The approach to clearing the cache is more manual and less integrated with the Nginx Helper plugin.

**Comparison:**
- Assistant A's approach is more aligned with the user's request to clear the Nginx Helper cache specifically.
- Assistant B's approach is more generic and assumes a different cache storage method, which may not be as relevant to the user's request.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant A's answer is more relevant and directly addresses the user's request to clear the Nginx Helper cache using the appropriate hooks and functions.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
