To address the error `sshd[54785]: error: kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host`, it is important to understand that this error typically occurs during the SSH key exchange process. Here are some potential root causes and steps to troubleshoot:

### Potential Root Causes:
1. **Network Issues**:
   - **Unstable Network**: An unstable or slow network connection can interrupt the key exchange process.
   - **Firewall Rules**: Firewalls on either the client or server side may be blocking the connection.

2. **Host Key Mismatch**:
   - **Known Hosts File**: The client may have an outdated or incorrect host key for the server in its `known_hosts` file.

3. **Server Configuration**:
   - **sshd_config**: The server's SSH configuration file (`sshd_config`) may have incorrect settings or unsupported algorithms.

4. **Client Configuration**:
   - **ssh_config**: The client's SSH configuration file (`ssh_config`) may have incorrect settings or unsupported algorithms.

5. **Server Load or Resource Limitations**:
   - **High Load**: The server may be experiencing high load or resource limitations, causing it to close the connection.

6. **Incompatible SSH Versions**:
   - **Protocol Versions**: The client and server may be using incompatible SSH protocol versions.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Check Logs**:
   - **Server Logs**: Review the server logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`) for more detailed information about the error.
   - **Client Logs**: Use the `-v` (verbose) option with the SSH command to get more detailed output on the client side.

2. **Verify Network Connectivity**:
   - **Ping Test**: Ensure there are no network connectivity issues by pinging the server.
   - **Firewall Rules**: Check and adjust firewall rules to allow SSH traffic.

3. **Update Known Hosts**:
   - **Remove Old Host Key**: Remove the old host key from the client's `known_hosts` file using `ssh-keygen -R <hostname>`.

4. **Check SSH Configuration**:
   - **Server Configuration**: Verify the server's `sshd_config` for any misconfigurations or unsupported options.
   - **Client Configuration**: Verify the client's `ssh_config` for any misconfigurations or unsupported options.

5. **Monitor Server Load**:
   - **Resource Usage**: Check the server's resource usage (CPU, memory) to ensure it is not overloaded.

6. **Ensure Compatibility**:
   - **SSH Versions**: Ensure both the client and server are using compatible versions of the SSH protocol.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of the `kex_exchange_identification` error.
