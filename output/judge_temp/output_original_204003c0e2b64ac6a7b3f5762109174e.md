To solve a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here is a Python function that implements this formula:

```python
import cmath

def solve_quadratic(a, b, c):
    """
    Solves a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

    Args:
        a (float): Coefficient of x^2.
        b (float): Coefficient of x.
        c (float): Constant term.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the two roots of the equation.
    """
    # Calculate the discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

    # Calculate the two solutions using the quadratic formula
    root1 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    root2 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

    return root1, root2

# Example usage:
a = 1
b = -3
c = 2
solutions = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)
print(f"The solutions are {solutions[0]} and {solutions[1]}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing cmath**: The `cmath` module is used to handle complex numbers, which allows the function to return complex roots if the discriminant is negative.
2. **Discriminant Calculation**: The discriminant \( b^2 - 4ac \) is calculated to determine the nature of the roots.
3. **Root Calculation**: The roots are calculated using the quadratic formula. The `cmath.sqrt` function is used to ensure that the square root of a negative number is handled correctly, returning a complex number.
4. **Return Roots**: The function returns a tuple containing the two roots.

### Example Usage:
The function is called with example coefficients \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = 2 \). The solutions are then printed.

### Evaluation of Assistant A and B's Answers:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Uses `cmath` to handle complex roots, which is good for completeness.
- Provides a clear and concise implementation.
- Includes an example usage.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Uses `math` module, which only handles real roots and raises an error for complex roots.
- Provides a detailed explanation and includes error handling for cases with no real roots.
- Includes an example usage.

**Comparison:**
- **Correctness**: Both answers are correct, but Assistant A's use of `cmath` makes it more robust as it handles both real and complex roots.
- **Helpfulness**: Both answers are helpful, but Assistant A's solution is more comprehensive as it does not exclude complex roots.
- **Relevance**: Both answers are relevant to the prompt.
- **Conciseness**: Assistant A's answer is more concise, while Assistant B's answer includes more detailed explanations and error handling.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant A's answer is more robust and concise, handling both real and complex roots without raising errors. Therefore, it is slightly better.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
