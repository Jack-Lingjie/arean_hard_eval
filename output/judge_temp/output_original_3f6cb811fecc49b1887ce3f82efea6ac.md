To address the user prompt, the Python program should calculate the maximum number of continuous zeroes surrounded by ones in a binary string. Here is a solution:

```python
def max_continuous_zeroes(binary_string):
    max_zeroes = 0
    current_zeroes = 0
    in_zero_sequence = False

    for i in range(1, len(binary_string) - 1):
        if binary_string[i] == '0' and binary_string[i-1] == '1' and binary_string[i+1] == '1':
            current_zeroes += 1
            in_zero_sequence = True
        elif binary_string[i] == '0' and in_zero_sequence:
            current_zeroes += 1
        else:
            if in_zero_sequence:
                max_zeroes = max(max_zeroes, current_zeroes)
                current_zeroes = 0
                in_zero_sequence = False

    if in_zero_sequence:
        max_zeroes = max(max_zeroes, current_zeroes)

    return max_zeroes

# Example usage:
binary_string = input("Enter a binary string: ")
result = max_continuous_zeroes(binary_string)
print("Max number of continuous zeroes surrounded by 1s:", result)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `max_zeroes` to store the maximum number of continuous zeroes found so far, `current_zeroes` to track the current number of continuous zeroes, and `in_zero_sequence` to track if we are in a sequence of zeroes surrounded by ones.
2. **Iteration**: Iterate over each character in the binary string starting from the second character and ending at the second last character.
3. **Handling Zeroes**: If the current character is '0' and it is surrounded by '1's, increment `current_zeroes` and set `in_zero_sequence` to True. If the current character is '0' and we are already in a zero sequence, increment `current_zeroes`.
4. **Handling Ones**: If the current character is '1' and we are in a zero sequence, update `max_zeroes` if `current_zeroes` is greater, reset `current_zeroes`, and set `in_zero_sequence` to False.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, if we are still in a zero sequence, update `max_zeroes` if necessary.
6. **Return**: Return `max_zeroes` after iterating over the entire string.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- The logic in Assistant A's code is flawed. It does not correctly handle the requirement of zeroes being surrounded by ones. It only checks if the previous character was '1' and does not ensure that the zeroes are surrounded by ones on both sides.
- The code is concise but incorrect for the given problem.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Assistant B's code does not address the requirement of zeroes being surrounded by ones. It simply counts the maximum number of continuous zeroes without checking if they are surrounded by ones.
- The explanation is detailed, but the solution does not meet the prompt's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Both answers fail to meet the prompt's requirements, but Assistant A's answer is closer to the correct logic by attempting to check for surrounding ones, even though it is not implemented correctly. Assistant B's answer does not address the requirement at all.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
