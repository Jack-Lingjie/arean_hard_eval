To estimate a machine capacity plan with fundamental unknowns like process times and investment availability, you can follow a structured approach that incorporates assumptions and communicates uncertainty. Here’s a step-by-step method:

1. **Identify and Gather Available Data**:
   - **Historical Data**: Collect any historical data on process times and past investments.
   - **Industry Benchmarks**: Use industry standards and benchmarks for similar processes.
   - **Expert Opinions**: Consult with industry experts to get estimates and insights.

2. **Make Assumptions**:
   - **Process Times**: If exact process times are unknown, use average values from historical data or industry benchmarks. Consider a range of values to account for variability.
   - **Investment Availability**: Estimate a range of possible investments based on your organization’s financial capabilities or past projects.

3. **Develop Scenarios**:
   - Create multiple scenarios using different combinations of your assumptions. This helps in understanding the impact of each variable on the capacity plan.

4. **Calculate Capacity**:
   - For each scenario, calculate the required machine capacity using standard capacity planning formulas. These formulas typically involve factors like process times, machine utilization rates, and desired output levels.

5. **Analyze Results**:
   - Compare the capacity requirements across different scenarios to identify trends and potential bottlenecks. This analysis helps in understanding the sensitivity of the capacity plan to changes in the unknown variables.

6. **Communicate Uncertainty**:
   - Present the results as a range or confidence interval. For example, you can state that the required machine capacity is estimated to be between X and Y units, with a certain confidence level (e.g., 95%). This communicates the potential variability in the capacity plan due to the unknown variables.

7. **Update Estimates**:
   - As more information becomes available, update your assumptions and re-run the capacity planning analysis. This iterative process helps in refining your estimates and reducing uncertainty over time.

### Example:
Suppose you are planning to purchase a machine, but the process time is unknown. Based on industry benchmarks, you estimate the process time to be between 2 and 5 hours.

- **Process Time**: Average of 2 and 5 hours = 3.5 hours
- **Investment Availability**: Estimated budget = $10,000

**Machine Capacity Plan**:
- **Capacity Requirements**: If you need to process 10 tasks per day and the machine operates for 8 hours a day, you need a machine that can handle approximately 1.14 tasks per hour (10 tasks / 8 hours).

**Uncertainty Value**:
- **Range of Values**: Considering the process time variability, the capacity requirement could range from 8 to 12 tasks per day.
- **Confidence Level**: You might state that there is an 80% confidence level that the machine can handle between 8 and 12 tasks per day.

By following these steps, you can estimate a machine capacity plan with fundamental unknowns and effectively communicate the approximations as uncertainty values.
