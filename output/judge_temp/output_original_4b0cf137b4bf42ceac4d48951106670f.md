Here is my own answer to the prompt:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int glob = 0;

int rep() {
    glob++;
    if (glob == 10) {
        return glob;
    } else {
        return rep();
    }
}

int main() {
    printf("Burger Time\n");
    size_t cnt = 0;
    while (1) {
        if (cnt % 32 == 0) {
            printf("What time is it?\n");
        }
        if (cnt++ == 100) {
            break;
        }
        printf("cnt: %zu\n", cnt);
    }
    return rep();
}
```

Key changes:
1. Removed the `using namespace std;` line as it is not needed.
2. Removed the commented-out line `//if (++cnt) { if (cnt++ == 100) { break; } }`.
3. Added a newline character (`\n`) to the `printf` statement for "Burger Time".
4. Added a newline character (`\n`) to the `printf` statement for "What time is it?".
5. Corrected the format specifier in the `printf` statement for `cnt` to `%zu` for `size_t`.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

**Assistant A's Answer:**

1. Removed the `using namespace std;` line.
2. Removed the commented-out line.
3. Did not add newline characters to the `printf` statements.
4. Did not correct the format specifier for `cnt`.

**Assistant B's Answer:**

1. Removed the `using namespace std;` line.
2. Removed the commented-out line.
3. Added newline characters to the `printf` statements.
4. Did not correct the format specifier for `cnt`.
5. Simplified the `rep` function by removing the unnecessary `else` clause.
6. Improved code formatting and added comments for better readability.

**Evaluation:**

- Both assistants correctly removed the dead code and the unnecessary `using namespace std;` line.
- Assistant B added newline characters to the `printf` statements, which improves readability.
- Assistant B also simplified the `rep` function and improved code formatting with comments, which enhances readability and maintainability.
- Neither assistant corrected the format specifier for `cnt`.

Given the improvements in readability and maintainability provided by Assistant B, despite the oversight regarding the format specifier, Assistant B's answer is more comprehensive and helpful.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
