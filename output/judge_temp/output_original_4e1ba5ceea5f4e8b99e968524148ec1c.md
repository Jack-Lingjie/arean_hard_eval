To quickly build a Keras script to train and categorize data from a CSV file, follow these steps:

1. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
   Ensure you have TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Scikit-learn installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras pandas scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Import Required Libraries**:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
   from keras.models import Sequential
   from keras.layers import Dense
   from keras.utils import to_categorical
   ```

3. **Load the CSV File**:

   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
   ```

4. **Preprocess the Data**:
   Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y). If necessary, preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling, or encoding categorical variables.

   ```python
   X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
   y = data['target_column']
   ```

5. **Encode the Target Variable if it's Categorical**:

   ```python
   encoder = LabelEncoder()
   y = encoder.fit_transform(y)
   y = to_categorical(y)
   ```

6. **Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**:

   ```python
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

7. **Build the Keras Model**:

   ```python
   model = Sequential()
   model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
   model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
   model.add(Dense(y.shape[1], activation='softmax'))

   model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
   ```

8. **Train the Model**:

   ```python
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
   ```

9. **Evaluate the Model**:

   ```python
   loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
   print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
   ```

10. **Save the Model for Future Use**:

    ```python
    model.save('keras_model.h5')
    ```

Remember to replace 'your_data.csv' with the path to your CSV file and 'target_column' with the name of the column you want to predict. Adjust the model architecture, epochs, and batch_size according to your specific problem and dataset.
