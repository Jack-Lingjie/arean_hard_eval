To address the user prompt, the function should return a list of objects containing the name, RAM usage, and CPU usage of every running program on the computer. Here is a complete and accurate implementation in VB.NET:

```vb
Imports System.Diagnostics
Imports System.Threading

Public Class Pgr
    Public Property Name As String
    Public Property RamUsage As Double
    Public Property CpuUsage As Double
End Class

Public Function GetProgramUsage() As List(Of Pgr)
    Dim programList As New List(Of Pgr)
    Dim processes As Process() = Process.GetProcesses()

    For Each process As Process In processes
        Dim program As New Pgr
        program.Name = process.ProcessName
        program.RamUsage = Math.Round(process.WorkingSet64 / 1024 / 1024, 2) ' Convert to MB

        Try
            Dim processCpuCounter As New PerformanceCounter("Process", "% Processor Time", process.ProcessName, True)
            processCpuCounter.NextValue()
            Thread.Sleep(500) ' Wait for a moment to get an accurate reading
            program.CpuUsage = Math.Round(processCpuCounter.NextValue() / Environment.ProcessorCount, 2)
        Catch ex As Exception
            program.CpuUsage = 0
        End Try

        programList.Add(program)
    Next

    Return programList
End Function
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports and Class Definition**: The `System.Diagnostics` namespace is imported to access process information. A `Pgr` class is defined to hold the name, RAM usage, and CPU usage of each process.
2. **GetProgramUsage Function**:
   - A list of `Pgr` objects is initialized.
   - All running processes are retrieved using `Process.GetProcesses()`.
   - For each process, a new `Pgr` object is created, and its `Name` and `RamUsage` properties are set.
   - The `PerformanceCounter` class is used to get the CPU usage. The `NextValue` method is called twice with a delay in between to get an accurate reading.
   - The CPU usage is divided by the number of processors to get the per-processor usage.
   - The `Pgr` object is added to the list.
3. **Return**: The list of `Pgr` objects is returned.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
- **Correctness**: The answer is mostly correct but has a minor issue. The `PerformanceCounter` should be instantiated with the `True` parameter to avoid issues with process names containing special characters.
- **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and provides a working solution.
- **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt.
- **Conciseness**: The answer is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
- **Correctness**: The answer has significant issues. The `GetCpuUsage` function incorrectly calculates CPU usage by using `TotalProcessorTime.TotalSeconds`, which is not a measure of current CPU usage but cumulative CPU time since the process started.
- **Helpfulness**: The answer is less helpful due to the incorrect CPU usage calculation.
- **Relevance**: The answer is relevant but flawed in its approach.
- **Conciseness**: The answer is clear but includes unnecessary complexity by splitting the RAM and CPU usage calculations into separate functions.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A provides a more accurate and helpful solution to the prompt, despite a minor issue that can be easily corrected. Assistant B's approach to CPU usage is fundamentally flawed.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
