To cross-validate using ShuffleSplit in scikit-learn, you can follow these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load your dataset.
3. Initialize your model.
4. Create a ShuffleSplit object.
5. Perform cross-validation using the ShuffleSplit object.

Here is an example using the Iris dataset and a logistic regression model:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit, cross_val_score
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

# Create a ShuffleSplit object
shuffle_split = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=5, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Perform cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=shuffle_split)

# Calculate the average score
average_score = np.mean(scores)
print(f"Average score: {average_score:.2f}")
```

In this example:
- We load the Iris dataset and extract the features (`X`) and target (`y`).
- We initialize a logistic regression model.
- We create a `ShuffleSplit` object with 5 splits and a test size of 30%.
- We use `cross_val_score` to perform cross-validation, which automatically handles the splitting, training, and evaluation.
- Finally, we calculate and print the average cross-validation score.

This approach leverages `cross_val_score` to simplify the cross-validation process, making the code more concise and easier to understand.
