To get the number of unresponsive pods in a Kubernetes cluster using PromQL, you can use the `kube_pod_status_phase` metric, which provides information about the status of the pods. Unresponsive pods are typically in the "Unknown" phase. Here is a PromQL query to get the number of unresponsive pods:

```promql
sum(kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Unknown"})
```

This query sums up the number of pods that are in the "Unknown" phase, which indicates that they are unresponsive. Ensure that you have the Prometheus Kubernetes SD configuration set up and the `kube-state-metrics` service running in your cluster to collect these metrics.

Alternatively, you can also check for pods that are not ready by using the `kube_pod_status_condition` metric. Here is another query that can be used:

```promql
sum(kube_pod_status_condition{condition="Ready", status="False"})
```

This query sums up the number of pods that are not in the "Ready" state, which can also be an indicator of unresponsive pods.

Make sure that the metrics you are querying are available in your Prometheus setup and that your cluster is configured to expose these metrics.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and Assistant B's Answers:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- **Correctness:** The answer correctly identifies the `kube_pod_status_phase` metric and provides a valid PromQL query to find unresponsive pods.
- **Helpfulness:** The answer is helpful and directly addresses the user's question.
- **Relevance:** The answer is relevant and focused on the user's query.
- **Conciseness:** The answer is concise and to the point.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- **Correctness:** The answer provides a more detailed explanation and suggests using the `kube_pod_status_condition` metric, which is also a valid approach. However, it does not mention the `kube_pod_status_phase` metric, which is more directly related to the "Unknown" phase.
- **Helpfulness:** The answer is helpful and provides additional context and steps for the user.
- **Relevance:** The answer is relevant but slightly more verbose.
- **Conciseness:** The answer is detailed but could be more concise.

**Final Verdict:**
While both answers are correct and helpful, Assistant A's answer is more concise and directly addresses the user's query with the most relevant metric. Assistant B's answer provides additional context and an alternative approach, which is useful but slightly more verbose.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
