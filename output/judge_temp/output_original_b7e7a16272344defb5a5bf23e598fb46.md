To create a simple UI for a chatbot using Gradio, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Gradio**: First, you need to install the Gradio library. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   pip install gradio
   ```

2. **Create the Python Script**: Next, you can create a Python script to build a simple chatbot UI using Gradio. Here is an example script:

   ```python
   import gradio as gr

   def chatbot_response(user_input):
       """
       Simulates a chatbot response.

       Args:
       - user_input (str): The user's message.

       Returns:
       - str: The chatbot's response.
       """
       # Simple chatbot logic: respond with a greeting or a generic message
       if user_input.lower() == "hello":
           return "Hello! How can I assist you?"
       else:
           return "I didn't quite understand that. Please try again."

   # Create a Gradio interface
   demo = gr.Interface(
       fn=chatbot_response,  # Function to run
       inputs=gr.Textbox(label="User Input"),  # Input field
       outputs=gr.Textbox(label="Chatbot Response"),  # Output field
       title="Simple Chatbot",  # Interface title
       description="A basic chatbot interface.",  # Interface description
   )

   # Launch the interface
   demo.launch()
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: Save the script as `chatbot.py` and execute it using:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

4. **Access the Interface**: After running the script, a URL will be displayed in the terminal. Open this URL in a web browser to access the chatbot interface.

### Explanation:
- **Importing Libraries**: The script begins by importing the necessary library, `gradio`.
- **Defining the Chatbot Function**: The `chatbot_response` function simulates how the chatbot responds to user input. It checks if the user's input is "hello" and returns a greeting. Otherwise, it returns a generic message.
- **Creating the Gradio Interface**: The `demo` variable is assigned a Gradio interface. This interface includes:
  - **Input Field**: A text box where users can input their messages.
  - **Output Field**: A text box to display the chatbot's response.
  - **Interface Title and Description**: These are set to provide context about the interface.
- **Launching the Interface**: Finally, the `launch` method is called to start the Gradio interface.

This basic example demonstrates how to create a simple chatbot interface using Gradio. You can enhance this by integrating more sophisticated chatbot logic or machine learning models.
