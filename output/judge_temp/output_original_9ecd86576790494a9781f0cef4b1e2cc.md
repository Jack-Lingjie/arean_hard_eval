To address the user's prompt on how to specify which config file to read for a Flask application running in a Docker container, using an environment variable is indeed a suitable approach. Here is a comprehensive answer:

1. **Modify the Flask Application to Read from an Environment Variable:**

   Update your Flask application to read the config file path from an environment variable:

   ```python
   import os
   import json
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   config_file = os.environ.get('FLASK_CONFIG_FILE')
   if config_file:
       app.config.from_file(config_file, load=json.load)
   else:
       raise RuntimeError("FLASK_CONFIG_FILE environment variable not set")
   ```

2. **Update the Dockerfile:**

   Ensure your Dockerfile sets the environment variable and copies the necessary files:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
   FROM python:3.8-slim

   # Set the working directory to /app
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
   COPY . /app

   # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

   # Set the environment variable for the Flask config file
   ENV FLASK_CONFIG_FILE /app/config.json

   # Expose port 80
   EXPOSE 80

   # Run the application
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Container:**

   Build the Docker image and run the container:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-flask-app .
   docker run -p 4000:80 your-flask-app
   ```

4. **Override the Environment Variable if Needed:**

   If you need to use a different config file, you can override the environment variable when running the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 4000:80 -e FLASK_CONFIG_FILE=/app/another_config.json your-flask-app
   ```

This approach allows you to dynamically specify the configuration file for your Flask application using environment variables, making it flexible and easy to manage different configurations.
