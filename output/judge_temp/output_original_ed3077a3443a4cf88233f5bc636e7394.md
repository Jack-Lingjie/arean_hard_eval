If I were a corporate lawyer with 15 years of mergers and acquisitions experience looking to pivot to launch an AI-enabled tech startup, I would follow these steps:

1. **Identify a Niche**:
   - Determine the specific area within AI that interests you and has market potential. This could be natural language processing, computer vision, predictive analytics, etc.

2. **Educate Yourself**:
   - Take online courses, attend workshops, and read extensively about AI technologies and their applications. Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udacity offer specialized AI courses.

3. **Develop a Business Plan**:
   - Outline your startup’s mission, vision, target market, competitive landscape, and revenue model. Include detailed plans for product development, marketing, sales, and operations.

4. **Build a Team**:

5. **Secure Funding**:
   - Explore various funding options such as venture capital, angel investors, and government grants. Prepare a compelling pitch deck that highlights your startup’s potential and your team’s expertise.

6. **Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
   - Work with your team to design, develop, and test a functional prototype of your AI-enabled product or service. Ensure it meets the needs of your target market and complies with relevant regulations.

7. **Protect Intellectual Property**:
   - Consult with an intellectual property attorney to secure patents, trademarks, and copyrights for your product and brand.

8. **Establish a Legal Entity**:
   - Register your startup as a legal entity, such as a corporation or limited liability company (LLC). Ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations.

9. **Create a Go-to-Market Strategy**:
   - Develop a marketing plan that includes branding, messaging, and promotional tactics to reach your target audience. Leverage your existing network and industry connections to generate buzz and attract early adopters.

10. **Launch Your Startup**:
    - Officially launch your AI-enabled tech startup and begin selling your product or service. Monitor your progress, gather feedback from customers, and make adjustments as needed to improve your offering and grow your business.

11. **Scale Your Business**:
    - As your startup gains traction, explore opportunities to expand your product line, enter new markets, and grow your team. Continuously refine your business strategy and operations to maximize efficiency and profitability.

12. **Maintain a Strong Company Culture**:
    - Foster open communication, promote work-life balance, and celebrate successes to build a positive and productive work environment.

13. **Stay Adaptable and Informed**:
    - Continuously monitor market trends and be willing to pivot your strategy if necessary. Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends through workshops, conferences, and industry publications.

14. **Network and Build Relationships**:
    - Attend industry events, join relevant communities, and establish connections with potential partners and investors to support your startup’s growth.

15. **Use Project Management Tools**:
