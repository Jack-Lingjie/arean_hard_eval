To address the user's prompt, the goal is to find the minimum subset of variables from a set of $n$ variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ that can effectively distinguish between examples labeled as solution (+) or non-solution (-). This problem can be approached using feature selection techniques. Here is a comprehensive answer:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Define the Problem**:
   - You have a dataset with $n$ variables and each example is labeled as either a solution (+) or non-solution (-).
   - The objective is to identify the smallest subset of these variables that can still accurately classify the examples.

2. **Feature Selection Techniques**:
   - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: This technique recursively removes the least important features based on a classifier's performance until the desired number of features is reached.
   - **Decision Trees**: Decision trees can be used to identify important features. By constructing and pruning a decision tree, you can determine which variables are essential for classification.
   - **Information Gain**: Calculate the information gain for each variable to determine its importance in distinguishing between the classes.

### Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

1. **Initialize**:
   - Start with the full set of variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$.
   
2. **Train Classifier**:
   - Train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree) on the dataset using all variables.
   
3. **Evaluate Importance**:
   - Evaluate the importance of each variable using the classifier's coefficients or feature importances.
   
4. **Eliminate Least Important Variable**:
   - Remove the least important variable from the set.
   
5. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat steps 2-4 until the performance of the classifier starts to degrade significantly or until you reach the desired number of variables.

### Decision Tree Approach

1. **Construct Decision Tree**:
   - Build a decision tree where each internal node represents a variable and each leaf node represents a class label (+ or -).
   
2. **Prune the Tree**:
   - Prune the tree to remove branches that do not contribute significantly to the decision-making process.
   
3. **Extract Important Variables**:
   - The variables that remain in the pruned decision tree form the minimum subset required for classification.

### Example Implementation

Here is an example using a decision tree approach in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE

# Define the data
data = {
    'x1': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    'x2': [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    'x3': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    'label': [-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
X = df.drop('label', axis=1)
y = df['label']

# Initialize the Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Fit the model
clf.fit(X, y)

# Perform Recursive Feature Elimination
rfe = RFE(clf, n_features_to_select=1)
rfe.fit(X, y)

# Get the ranking of features
ranking = rfe.ranking_

# Print the ranking of features
print("Feature ranking:", ranking)
```

### Explanation

- The code defines the dataset and converts it into a pandas DataFrame.
- It initializes a decision tree classifier and fits it to the data.
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is performed to rank the features based on their importance.
- The ranking of features is printed, indicating the importance of each variable.

### Conclusion

Both Recursive Feature Elimination and Decision Tree approaches can be used to find the minimum subset of variables required to distinguish between (+) and (-) examples. The choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand.
