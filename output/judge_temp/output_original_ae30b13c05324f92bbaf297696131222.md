**Enhanced Prompt**

**Task:** Generate a set of relevant tags for each document in my Obsidian vault based on their text content.

**Instructions:**

1. **Context and Outcome**: The tags should accurately represent the main topics and themes discussed in each document. These tags will help in organizing and searching for related content within the Obsidian vault.
2. **Length, Format, and Style**: For each document, generate a list of 5-10 tags. The tags should be formatted as a comma-separated list (e.g., #tag1, #tag2, #tag3). Use single words or short phrases, written in lowercase, and use hyphens to separate words if necessary (e.g., #project-management).
3. **Examples of Desired Output**:
   - For a document discussing productivity tips and time management, the generated tags could be: #productivity, #time-management, #efficiency, #work-tips, #task-organization.
   - For a document about travel planning, the tags could be: #travel, #planning, #adventure, #itinerary, #budget-travel.
4. **Leading Words or Phrases**: To generate the tags, you may use natural language processing techniques or keyword extraction algorithms, such as TF-IDF or RAKE.
5. **Avoid Vague Language**: Instead of saying "avoid irrelevant tags," specify that "the generated tags should be closely related to the document's content and not include generic or unrelated terms."
6. **Guidance on What to Do**: Focus on identifying specific topics and themes that are central to the document's content. Avoid generating tags that are too broad or generic.
