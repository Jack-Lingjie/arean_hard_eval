To implement the Targeted Fast Gradient Sign Method (T-FGSM) in Python, you can use popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Below is a step-by-step guide using both libraries.

### Using TensorFlow

1. **Import necessary libraries:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
```

2. **Load your pre-trained model:**

```python
model = load_model('your_model.h5')
```

3. **Define the T-FGSM function:**

```python
def targeted_fgsm(input_image, target_class, model, epsilon):
    input_image = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_image, dtype=tf.float32)
    target_class = tf.one_hot(target_class, model.output_shape[-1])

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(input_image)
        prediction = model(input_image)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(target_class, prediction)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, input_image)
    signed_gradients = tf.sign(gradients)
    adversarial_image = input_image - epsilon * signed_gradients
    adversarial_image = tf.clip_by_value(adversarial_image, 0, 1)

    return adversarial_image.numpy()
```

4. **Generate an adversarial example:**

```python
input_image = np.expand_dims(your_input_image, axis=0)  # Assuming your_input_image is a NumPy array
target_class = 5  # The target class you want the model to predict
epsilon = 0.01  # The perturbation magnitude

adversarial_image = targeted_fgsm(input_image, target_class, model, epsilon)
```

5. **Test the adversarial example on the model:**

```python
original_prediction = np.argmax(model.predict(input_image), axis=1)
adversarial_prediction = np.argmax(model.predict(adversarial_image), axis=1)

print(f"Original prediction: {original_prediction}")
print(f"Adversarial prediction: {adversarial_prediction}")
```

### Using PyTorch

1. **Import necessary libraries:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
```

2. **Load your pre-trained model:**

```python
model = torch.load('your_model.pth')
model.eval()
```

3. **Define the T-FGSM function:**

```python
def targeted_fgsm(model, input_image, target_class, epsilon):
    input_image = input_image.clone().detach().requires_grad_(True)
    target_class = torch.tensor([target_class])

    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    output = model(input_image)
    loss = criterion(output, target_class)
    model.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()

    gradient = input_image.grad.data
    signed_gradient = gradient.sign()
    adversarial_image = input_image - epsilon * signed_gradient
    adversarial_image = torch.clamp(adversarial_image, 0, 1)

    return adversarial_image
```

4. **Generate an adversarial example:**

```python
input_image = your_input_image.unsqueeze(0)  # Assuming your_input_image is a torch.Tensor
target_class = 5  # The target class you want the model to predict
epsilon = 0.01  # The perturbation magnitude

adversarial_image = targeted_fgsm(model, input_image, target_class, epsilon)
```

5. **Test the adversarial example on the model:**

```python
original_prediction = model(input_image).argmax(dim=1)
adversarial_prediction = model(adversarial_image).argmax(dim=1)

print(f"Original prediction: {original_prediction.item()}")
print(f"Adversarial prediction: {adversarial_prediction.item()}")
```

### Summary

- **Choose the Right Library:** Select either TensorFlow or PyTorch based on your project's requirements.
- **Adjust Hyperparameters:** Experiment with different values of `epsilon` to achieve the desired level of perturbation.
- **Monitor Model Performance:** Regularly evaluate your model's performance on clean and adversarial data.
