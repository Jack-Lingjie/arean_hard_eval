To calculate the rolling average stock for the ClickHouse table `stocks` with columns `date`, `article_id`, `stock_a`, `stock_b`, and `stock_c`, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    date,
    article_id,
    AVG(stock_a) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_a,
    AVG(stock_b) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_b,
    AVG(stock_c) OVER (PARTITION BY article_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_stock_c
FROM
    stocks
ORDER BY
    date, article_id;
```

### Explanation:
- **`PARTITION BY article_id`**: This clause groups the result set by `article_id`, ensuring that the average is calculated separately for each article.
- **`ORDER BY date`**: This clause sorts the rows within each partition by `date`, which is necessary for the window function to operate correctly.
- **`ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`**: This specifies the window over which the average is calculated. In this case, it's the current row and the 2 preceding rows, making the window size 3.

### Note:
- The window size is set to 3 in this example. You can adjust the `ROWS BETWEEN` clause to change the window size as needed.
- Ensure that your ClickHouse version supports window functions.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Correctly uses window functions to calculate the rolling average.
- Sets a window size of 3, which is appropriate and matches the example provided.
- Provides a clear explanation of the query components.
- The use of `WITH window_size AS 3` is a good practice for readability and maintainability.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Correctly uses window functions to calculate the rolling average.
- Sets a window size of 8 (7 preceding rows and the current row), which is different from the example provided.
- Provides a detailed explanation of the query components.
- Includes an example use case, which is helpful for understanding.

### Comparison:
- Both answers are correct in terms of SQL syntax and usage of window functions.
- Assistant A's answer is more concise and directly addresses the prompt with a window size of 3.
- Assistant B's answer provides additional context and an example use case, but the window size of 8 may not align with the user's expectations.

### Verdict:
Given that the user prompt did not specify a window size, and Assistant A's answer is more concise and directly addresses the prompt with a reasonable window size of 3, I find Assistant A's response slightly better.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
