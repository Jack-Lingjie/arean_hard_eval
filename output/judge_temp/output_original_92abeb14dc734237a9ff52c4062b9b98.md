To prove that \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \) is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), we need to show that every ideal in the ring of integers of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \) is principal, i.e., generated by a single element.

### Step 1: Identify the Ring of Integers
The ring of integers of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \) is \( \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-11}] \), which consists of elements of the form \( a + b\sqrt{-11} \) where \( a, b \) are integers.

### Step 2: Norm Function
For any element \( \alpha = a + b\sqrt{-11} \) in \( \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-11}] \), define the norm \( N(\alpha) = \alpha \overline{\alpha} = (a + b\sqrt{-11})(a - b\sqrt{-11}) = a^2 + 11b^2 \).

### Step 3: Minkowski's Bound
To determine the structure of the ideal class group, we use Minkowski's bound. For a quadratic field \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}) \), the bound is given by:
\[ M = \frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{|d|} \]
For \( d = -11 \):
\[ M = \frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{11} \approx 2.1 \]

### Step 4: Check Ideals with Norms Less Than Minkowski's Bound
We need to check the norms of elements in \( \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-11}] \) that are less than or equal to 2.

1. **Norm 1**: \( a^2 + 11b^2 = 1 \)
   - The only solutions are \( (a, b) = (1, 0) \) and \( (-1, 0) \), corresponding to the trivial ideal \( (1) \).

2. **Norm 2**: \( a^2 + 11b^2 = 2 \)
   - There are no integer solutions for \( (a, b) \).

Since there are no non-trivial ideals with norms less than or equal to Minkowski's bound, the ideal class group is trivial, meaning every ideal in \( \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-11}] \) is principal.

### Conclusion
Therefore, \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-11}) \) is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID).
