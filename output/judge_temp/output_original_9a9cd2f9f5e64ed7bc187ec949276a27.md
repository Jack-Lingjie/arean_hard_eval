To address the user prompt, we need to write a Python function `modularity_gain` that works with the provided code. The function should calculate the modularity gain when moving a node from one community to another. Additionally, we need to define the `expected_edges` function, which calculates the expected number of edges between nodes based on the degree of nodes.

Here is the complete solution:

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np

def expected_edges(A, m):
    k = A.sum(axis=1)
    return np.outer(k, k) / (2 * m)

def modularity_gain(A, ee, i, c1, c2, m):
    ki_in = A[i, c1].sum() - A[i, i]
    ki_out = A[i, c2].sum()
    delta_q = (ki_in - ki_out - ee[i, c1].sum() + ee[i, c2].sum()) / (2 * m)
    return delta_q

G = nx.complete_graph(6)
m1 = nx.algorithms.community.modularity(G, [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]])
m2 = nx.algorithms.community.modularity(G, [[0, 1], [2, 3, 4, 5]])
nx_gain = m2 - m1
nx_mod = nx.algorithms.community.modularity
del nx.algorithms.community.modularity

try:
    A = nx.to_numpy_array(G)
    m = G.number_of_edges()
    ee = expected_edges(A, m)
    gain = modularity_gain(A, ee, 2, [0, 1], [3, 4, 5], m)
except:
    raise AssertionError('networkx modularity usage')
finally:
    nx.algorithms.community.modularity = nx_mod
    del nx_mod

assert np.isclose(nx_gain, gain)
```

### Explanation:
1. **expected_edges Function**: This function calculates the expected number of edges between nodes based on their degrees.
2. **modularity_gain Function**: This function calculates the modularity gain when moving a node from one community to another. It uses the adjacency matrix `A`, the expected edges matrix `ee`, the node index `i`, the two communities `c1` and `c2`, and the total number of edges `m`.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and Assistant B's Answers:

**Assistant A:**
- Correctly defines both `expected_edges` and `modularity_gain` functions.
- Provides a clear and concise implementation that matches the requirements of the prompt.
- The explanation is brief but covers the necessary details.

**Assistant B:**
- Provides a `modularity_gain` function but does not define the `expected_edges` function.
- The implementation of `modularity_gain` is more complex and deviates from the prompt's requirements by recalculating modularity using NetworkX functions, which is not necessary.
- The explanation is detailed but includes unnecessary steps and complexity.

### Conclusion:
Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the prompt, providing a correct and concise implementation of the required functions. Assistant B's answer, while detailed, introduces unnecessary complexity and does not fully address the prompt.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
