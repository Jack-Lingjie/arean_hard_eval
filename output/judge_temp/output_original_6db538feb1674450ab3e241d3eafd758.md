To achieve the highest tokens per second when running a large language model (LLM) on a local PC, you need to focus on several key hardware components. Here are the most critical ones:

1. **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**:
   - **Recommended**: High-end NVIDIA GPUs are generally the best choice due to their superior performance in deep learning tasks. Models like the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, NVIDIA A100, or NVIDIA Titan RTX are excellent options. These GPUs have a large number of CUDA cores and high memory bandwidth, which are essential for parallel processing and handling large models.

2. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**:
   - **Recommended**: A fast, multi-core processor is crucial for managing tasks efficiently and reducing potential bottlenecks. CPUs like the Intel Core i9 or AMD Ryzen 9 are good choices. These CPUs have high clock speeds and multiple cores, which are beneficial for running LLMs.

3. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
   - **Recommended**: Sufficient RAM is crucial for loading and processing large datasets. Aim for at least 64GB of high-speed DDR4 or DDR5 RAM, but 128GB or more is recommended for optimal performance.

4. **Storage**:
   - **Recommended**: A fast SSD (NVMe M.2 or PCIe) with ample storage capacity will help reduce loading times and improve overall system responsiveness. A 1TB or larger NVMe SSD is a good choice.

5. **Cooling**:
   - **Recommended**: Efficient cooling solutions are necessary to prevent overheating and maintain optimal performance. Consider high-performance air or liquid cooling systems for both the CPU and GPU.

6. **Power Supply**:
   - **Recommended**: A high-wattage power supply is essential to support the power-hungry components. A power supply with at least 850W and an 80+ Gold certification is advisable.

7. **Motherboard**:
   - **Recommended**: Ensure the motherboard supports your chosen CPU and GPU and has features like high-quality power delivery, multiple USB ports, and sufficient PCIe slots. A high-end motherboard with good stability and performance is ideal.

### Example Configuration

- **CPU**: Intel Core i9-13900K
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090
- **RAM**: 128GB DDR5 RAM
- **Storage**: 1TB NVMe SSD
- **Motherboard**: High-end motherboard supporting the chosen CPU
- **Power Supply**: 1000W 80+ Gold certified power supply

### Additional Tips

- **Operating System**: Use a 64-bit version of an operating system like Windows 11 or Linux.
- **LLM Software**: Choose a software framework that supports your chosen hardware and is optimized for LLMs.

By following these guidelines, you can build a high-performance PC capable of generating a large number of tokens per second when running an LLM.
