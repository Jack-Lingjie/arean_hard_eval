To solve a Rubik's Cube, a young person can follow the Layer-by-Layer method, which is a beginner-friendly approach. Here is a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Solve the White Cross
1. **Choose the white face** and create a white cross on the top layer. Ensure that the edge pieces of the cross match the center colors of the adjacent faces.
2. **Align the edges**: Rotate the top layer to align the white edge pieces with the center pieces of the adjacent faces.

### Step 2: Solve the White Corners
1. **Find a white corner piece** on the bottom layer.
2. **Position the corner**: Move the corner piece below the spot where it needs to go on the top layer.
3. **Use the algorithm**: Apply the algorithm R U R' U' to move the corner piece to the correct position. Repeat until all white corners are solved.

### Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer Edges
1. **Find an edge piece** in the top layer that does not have the top color (white).
2. **Position the edge**: Move the edge piece above the center piece it matches.
3. **Use the algorithm**:
   - To move the edge piece to the left: U' L' U L U F U' F'
   - To move the edge piece to the right: U R U' R' U' F' U F
4. **Repeat** until all middle layer edges are solved.

### Step 4: Create the Yellow Cross
1. **Form a yellow cross** on the bottom layer (opposite of the white face).
2. **Use the algorithm**: If you have a yellow dot, a horizontal line, or an L-shape, use the algorithm F R U R' U' F' to form the yellow cross.

### Step 5: Align the Yellow Cross Edges
1. **Align the edges**: Rotate the top layer to align the yellow cross edges with their corresponding center colors.
2. **Use the algorithm**: If two adjacent edge pieces are correctly aligned, use the algorithm R U R' U R U2 R' U to align all edges.

### Step 6: Position the Yellow Corners
1. **Find unsolved yellow corners**: Hold the cube with any unsolved corner in the front-right position.
2. **Use the algorithm**: Apply the algorithm U R U' L' U R' U' L to position the yellow corners correctly. Repeat until all corners are in their correct positions.

### Step 7: Orient the Yellow Corners
1. **Orient the corners**: Hold the cube with an unsolved yellow corner in the front-right position.
2. **Use the algorithm**: Apply the algorithm R' D' R D to orient the corner. Repeat until the corner is solved, then turn the bottom layer to position the next unsolved corner in the front-right position. Repeat until all corners are oriented correctly.

### Conclusion
Congratulations! You have now solved the Rubik's Cube using the Layer-by-Layer method. Practice these steps and algorithms to improve your speed and become more comfortable with solving the cube.
