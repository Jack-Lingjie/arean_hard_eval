### My Answer to the Prompt

Algorithm for Spill Removal after Chroma-Key Processing:

1. **Input**:
   - Image with an alpha channel (RGBA format)
   - Chroma color (Rc, Gc, Bc)

2. **Initialize** a new empty image with the same dimensions as the input image.

3. **Loop through each pixel** in the input image:
   - For each pixel (i, j), extract its color and alpha values (R, G, B, A).
   - If the alpha value (A) is fully transparent (A = 0), copy the pixel color (R, G, B, A) to the corresponding position in the new image.
   - If the alpha value (A) is fully opaque (A = 255), perform the following steps:

      1. **Calculate the spill ratio** for each color channel:
         - Red spill ratio (Rs) = max(0, (R - Rc) / (255 - Rc))
         - Green spill ratio (Gs) = max(0, (G - Gc) / (255 - Gc))
         - Blue spill ratio (Bs) = max(0, (B - Bc) / (255 - Bc))

      2. **Calculate the spill suppression factor (SSF)** as the minimum of the spill ratios:
         - SSF = min(Rs, Gs, Bs)

      3. **Calculate the new color values** by suppressing the spill:
         - New red value (Rn) = R - SSF * (R - Rc)
         - New green value (Gn) = G - SSF * (G - Gc)
         - New blue value (Bn) = B - SSF * (B - Bc)

      4. **Copy the new color values** (Rn, Gn, Bn, A) to the corresponding position in the new image.

4. **Return** the new image with the spill removed.

This algorithm can be implemented in any programming language that supports image processing, such as Python with the PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV. The algorithm works for arbitrary chroma colors by taking the chroma color as an input and using it to calculate the spill ratios and suppression factor.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer

Assistant A's answer is very similar to my own. It provides a clear, step-by-step algorithm that is easy to follow and implement. The explanation of the spill ratio and suppression factor is detailed and accurate. The answer is concise and directly addresses the prompt.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer

Assistant B's answer takes a different approach by using HSV color space and morphological operations. While this method can be effective, it is more complex and less direct than the approach described in my answer and Assistant A's answer. The use of HSV color space and morphological operations may be more suitable for certain types of images, but it is not as straightforward for implementation as the method described by Assistant A.

### Final Verdict

Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the prompt and provides a clear, implementable algorithm. Assistant B's answer, while creative and potentially effective, is more complex and less directly related to the prompt.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
