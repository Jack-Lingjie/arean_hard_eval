To calculate π (pi) to a high degree of precision in Python, you can use various algorithms. One of the most efficient algorithms for this purpose is the Chudnovsky algorithm, which converges to π very quickly. Here is a Python implementation using the Chudnovsky algorithm:

```python
import decimal
import math

def chudnovsky_algorithm(precision):
    decimal.getcontext().prec = precision + 2  # Set precision
    C = 426880 * decimal.Decimal(10005).sqrt()
    M = 1
    L = 13591409
    X = 1
    K = 6
    S = L
    for i in range(1, precision):
        M = (K ** 3 - 16 * K) * M // i ** 3
        L += 545140134
        X *= -262537412640768000
        S += decimal.Decimal(M * L) / X
        K += 12
    pi = C / S
    decimal.getcontext().prec -= 2
    return +pi

precision = 100  # Number of decimal places
pi = chudnovsky_algorithm(precision)
print(pi)
```

This code calculates π to the specified precision (100 decimal places in this example). You can increase the precision value to calculate π to more decimal places, but keep in mind that it will require more time and resources.

Alternatively, you can use the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe (BBP) formula, which allows for the calculation of any binary digit of π without having to calculate the preceding digits. Here is a Python implementation using the BBP formula:

```python
def calculate_pi(n_terms):
    """
    Calculate Pi using the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula.

    Args:
    n_terms (int): The number of terms to use in the calculation.

    Returns:
    float: An approximation of Pi.
    """
    pi = 0.0
    for k in range(n_terms):
        pi += 1/(16**k) * (
            4/(8*k+1) -
            2/(8*k+4) -
            1/(8*k+5) -
            1/(8*k+6)
        )
    return pi

# Example usage:
n_terms = 1000000  # Increase this for a more accurate result
pi_approximation = calculate_pi(n_terms)
print(f"Approximation of Pi after {n_terms} terms: {pi_approximation}")
```

This code calculates π using the BBP formula. Increasing `n_terms` improves the accuracy of the π approximation but also increases computation time.

### Explanation:
- **Chudnovsky Algorithm**: This algorithm is highly efficient for calculating π to a large number of decimal places.
- **BBP Formula**: This formula is useful for calculating specific digits of π without needing to compute all preceding digits.

Both methods have their use cases depending on the required precision and computational resources available.
