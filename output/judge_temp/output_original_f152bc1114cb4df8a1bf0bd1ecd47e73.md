To filter and delete each row in an Excel table where the value of a certain column is 0, follow these steps:

1. **Open your Excel workbook** and select the worksheet containing the table you want to filter.

2. **Select the entire table** or the specific range of data you want to work with.

3. **Enable Filtering**:
   - Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel Ribbon.
   - Click on "Filter" in the "Sort & Filter" group. This will add filter arrows to the header row of your table.

4. **Apply the Filter**:
   - Click on the filter arrow in the header cell of the column you want to filter by.
   - In the drop-down menu, uncheck "Select All" to deselect all options.
   - Check the box next to "0" to filter the table to only show rows with a value of 0 in the specified column.

5. **Delete the Filtered Rows**:
   - With the filtered rows visible, select the entire rows by clicking on the row numbers on the left side of the worksheet. To select multiple rows, click on the first row number, hold down the "Shift" key, and click on the last row number.
   - Right-click on the selected rows and choose "Delete Row" from the context menu. This will delete all the rows with a value of 0 in the specified column.

6. **Clear the Filter**:
   - To remove the filter and show all the remaining rows, click on the filter arrow in the header cell again and choose "Select All" to select all options. Alternatively, you can go to the "Data" tab and click on "Clear" in the "Sort & Filter" group.

Now you have successfully filtered and deleted each row in the Excel table where the value of the specified column is 0.
