My answer to the prompt:

Welcome to the Riddle Game! I am your game master, and I will guide you through the riddles. Remember, you have unlimited tries to solve each riddle. Let's begin!

Riddle 1: Sort a sequence of numbers using bubble sort. What is the sequence in the second last step before the algorithm is done sorting? Please provide the sequence of numbers you want to sort.

Evaluation:

Assistant A's Answer:
1. Assistant A correctly introduces the game and sets the stage for the first riddle.
2. Assistant A asks the user to provide the sequence of numbers they want to sort, which is a good interactive approach but deviates from the specific sequence provided in the prompt.

Assistant B's Answer:
1. Assistant B also introduces the game and provides a clear structure.
2. Assistant B specifies the sequence of numbers `[5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]` for the bubble sort riddle, which aligns with the prompt.
3. Assistant B lists all the riddles and even mentions the final solution, which is against the prompt's instruction to not reveal the final solution before all riddles are solved.

Comparison:
- Assistant A maintains the role of the game master and does not reveal the final solution prematurely.
- Assistant B provides a specific sequence for the bubble sort riddle, which is helpful, but fails by revealing the final solution.

Given the critical error of revealing the final solution by Assistant B, Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the prompt's requirements.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
