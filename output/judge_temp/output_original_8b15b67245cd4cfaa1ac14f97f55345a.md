**My Answer:**

This JavaScript code is designed to handle a multi-step form, allowing users to navigate between different steps using "next" and "previous" buttons, and to handle form submission. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Selecting Elements:**
   - `const steps = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("form .step"));`
     - This line selects all elements with the class "step" within a form and converts the NodeList to an array.
   - `const nextBtn = document.querySelectorAll("form .next-btn");`
     - This line selects all elements with the class "next-btn" within a form.
   - `const prevBtn = document.querySelectorAll("form .previous-btn");`
     - This line selects all elements with the class "previous-btn" within a form.
   - `const form = document.querySelector("form");`
     - This line selects the first form element in the document.

2. **Adding Event Listeners:**
   - For each "next" button:
     - `nextBtn.forEach((button) => { button.addEventListener("click", () => { changeStep("next"); }); });`
     - This adds a click event listener to each "next" button, which calls the `changeStep` function with the argument "next".
   - For each "previous" button:
     - `prevBtn.forEach((button) => { button.addEventListener("click", () => { changeStep("prev"); }); });`
     - This adds a click event listener to each "previous" button, which calls the `changeStep` function with the argument "prev".

3. **Form Submission:**
   - `form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => { e.preventDefault(); const inputs = []; form.querySelectorAll("input").forEach((input) => { const { name, value } = input; inputs.push({ name, value }); }); console.log(inputs); form.reset(); });`
   - This adds a submit event listener to the form. When the form is submitted:
     - It prevents the default form submission behavior.
     - It collects all input values into an array of objects, each containing the input's name and value.
     - It logs the collected input values to the console.
     - It resets the form.

4. **Changing Steps:**
   - `function changeStep(btn) { let index = 0; const active = document.querySelector(".active"); index = steps.indexOf(active); steps[index].classList.remove("active"); if (btn === "next") { index++; } else if (btn === "prev") { index--; } steps[index].classList.add("active"); }`
   - This function handles changing the active step:
     - It finds the currently active step.
     - It removes the "active" class from the current step.
     - It increments or decrements the index based on whether the "next" or "prev" button was clicked.
     - It adds the "active" class to the new step.
