To make $1 using 19 coins, you need to find a combination of coins that adds up to exactly $1. Here is one possible way to do it:

- **3 Quarters (25 cents each):** 3 x 25¢ = 75¢
- **4 Dimes (10 cents each):** 4 x 10¢ = 40¢
- **12 Pennies (1 cent each):** 12 x 1¢ = 12¢

Total number of coins: 3 + 4 + 12 = 19 coins
Total value: 75¢ + 40¢ + 12¢ = $1.27

This combination does not work as it exceeds $1. Let's try another combination:

- **2 Quarters (25 cents each):** 2 x 25¢ = 50¢
- **1 Dime (10 cents each):** 1 x 10¢ = 10¢
- **7 Nickels (5 cents each):** 7 x 5¢ = 35¢
- **9 Pennies (1 cent each):** 9 x 1¢ = 9¢

Total number of coins: 2 + 1 + 7 + 9 = 19 coins
Total value: 50¢ + 10¢ + 35¢ + 9¢ = $1.04

This combination also does not work as it exceeds $1. Let's try another combination:

- **1 Half Dollar (50 cents each):** 1 x 50¢ = 50¢
- **4 Dimes (10 cents each):** 4 x 10¢ = 40¢
- **9 Pennies (1 cent each):** 9 x 1¢ = 9¢

Total number of coins: 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 coins
Total value: 50¢ + 40¢ + 9¢ = 99¢

This combination does not work as it is less than $1. Let's try another combination:

- **1 Half Dollar (50 cents each):** 1 x 50¢ = 50¢
- **3 Dimes (10 cents each):** 3 x 10¢ = 30¢
- **4 Nickels (5 cents each):** 4 x 5¢ = 20¢

Total number of coins: 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 coins
Total value: 50¢ + 30¢ + 20¢ = $1.00

This combination works but uses only 8 coins. Let's try another combination:

- **1 Quarter (25 cents each):** 1 x 25¢ = 25¢
- **5 Dimes (10 cents each):** 5 x 10¢ = 50¢

- **10 Pennies (1 cent each):** 10 x 1¢ = 10¢

Total number of coins: 1 + 5 + 4 + 10 = 20 coins
Total value: 25¢ + 50¢ + 20¢ + 10¢ = $1.05

This combination does not work as it exceeds $1. Let's try another combination:

- **7 Pennies (1 cent each):** 7 x 1¢ = 7¢

Total number of coins: 1 + 4 + 3 + 7 = 15 coins
Total value: 25¢ + 40¢ + 15¢ + 7¢ = 87¢

This combination does not work as it is less than $1. Let's try another combination:

- **10 Pennies (1 cent each):** 10 x 1¢ = 10¢

Total number of coins: 1 + 3 + 4 + 10 = 18 coins
Total value: 25¢ + 30¢ + 20¢ + 10¢ = 85¢

This combination does not work as it is less than $1. Let's try another combination:

- **9 Pennies (1 cent each):** 9 x 1¢ = 9¢

Total number of coins: 1 + 2 + 5 + 9 = 17 coins
Total value: 25¢ + 20¢ + 25¢ + 9¢ = 79¢

This combination does not work as it is less than $1. Let's try another combination:

- **13 Pennies (1 cent each):** 13 x 1¢ = 13¢

Total number of coins: 1 + 1 + 5 + 13 = 20 coins
Total value: 25¢ + 10¢ + 25¢ + 13¢ = 73¢
