To find the best rational approximation to \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}\), we can use the method of continued fractions. The continued fraction representation of \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}\) is periodic and can be approximated by truncating the continued fraction at different points to find the convergents.

The continued fraction for \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}\) is approximately \([2; 1, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, \ldots]\).

Here are the first few convergents:

1. \(2\)
2. \(\frac{3}{2}\)
3. \(\frac{19}{13}\)
4. \(\frac{22}{15}\)
5. \(\frac{157}{109}\)
6. \(\frac{180}{125}\)

Among these, \(\frac{19}{13}\) is a good approximation with a relatively small denominator. However, if higher accuracy is needed, one can use \(\frac{157}{109}\) or even further convergents.

Thus, \(\frac{19}{13}\) is a good rational approximation to \(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}\).
