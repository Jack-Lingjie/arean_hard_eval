To address the issue of upgrading Symfony from version 4 to 5 and resolving the `symfony/security` package constraint problem, here is a comprehensive solution:

### Problem Analysis
The error message indicates that your `composer.json` file requires `symfony/security` version 5.0.*, but the available versions do not match this constraint. This typically happens when the package versions specified in `composer.json` are not compatible with each other or with the desired Symfony version.

### Solution Steps

1. **Open `composer.json`**:
   - Locate the `composer.json` file in the root directory of your project.

2. **Update the `symfony/security` Constraint**:
   - Find the line that specifies the `symfony/security` package requirement. It might look like this:
     ```json
     "require": {
         "symfony/security": "5.0.*"
     }
     ```
   - Update the version constraint to allow for the latest stable version of Symfony 5. For example:
     ```json
     "require": {
         "symfony/security": "^5.0"
     }
     ```

3. **Run Composer Update**:
   - Execute the following command in your terminal to update the `symfony/security` package and other dependencies:
     ```bash
     composer update symfony/security
     ```

4. **Check for Compatibility**:
   - Ensure that your application code is compatible with Symfony 5. This may involve updating your code to use new features and APIs introduced in Symfony 5.
   - Refer to the [Symfony 5 upgrade guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/upgrade_major.html) for detailed instructions on upgrading your application.

5. **Test Your Application**:
   - After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure that everything works correctly with the new version of Symfony and its components.

### Example `composer.json` Update
Before:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "symfony/security": "4.4.*"
    }
}
```

After:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "symfony/security": "^5.0"
    }
}
```

### Additional Tips
- If you encounter further issues, consider updating other Symfony components to their compatible versions.
- Use the `composer outdated` command to check for other outdated dependencies that might need updating.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the version conflict and successfully upgrade your Symfony project from version 4 to 5.
