To mock a module in the `setupFilesAfterEnv` and implement a different mock in the test file using Jest, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a `setupFilesAfterEnv` file:**

   Create a file named `jest.setup.js` (or any name you prefer) in your project's root directory. This file will contain the global mock implementation.

2. **Add the `setupFilesAfterEnv` configuration in your `jest.config.js`:**

   In your `jest.config.js` file, add the following configuration:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     // ...
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./jest.setup.js'],
     // ...
   };
   ```

   This tells Jest to run the `jest.setup.js` file after setting up the testing environment.

3. **Mock the module in the `setupFilesAfterEnv` file:**

   In your `jest.setup.js` file, add the following code to mock the module globally:

   ```javascript
   // jest.setup.js
   jest.mock('./path/to/your/module', () => {
     return {
       functionName: jest.fn(() => 'global mock implementation'),
     };
   });
   ```

   Replace `./path/to/your/module` with the actual path to the module you want to mock, and `functionName` with the actual function name you want to mock.

4. **Implement a different mock in the test file:**

   In your test file, you can override the global mock implementation with a different mock implementation like this:

   ```javascript
   // your-test-file.test.js
   import { functionName } from './path/to/your/module';

   // Override the global mock implementation
   jest.mock('./path/to/your/module', () => {
     return {
       functionName: jest.fn(() => 'test-specific mock implementation'),
     };
   });

   describe('Your test suite', () => {
     test('Your test case', () => {
       // Your test logic here
       expect(functionName()).toBe('test-specific mock implementation');
     });
   });
   ```

Now, when you run your tests, the global mock implementation will be used for all test files except for the ones where you've overridden it with a test-specific mock implementation.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's and Assistant B's Answers:

**Assistant A:**
- Provides a clear and step-by-step guide on how to mock a module in `setupFilesAfterEnv` and override it in a test file.
- The instructions are detailed and include code snippets for both the global mock and the test-specific mock.
- The response is relevant, concise, and directly addresses the user prompt.

**Assistant B:**
- The response is also clear and provides a step-by-step guide.
- However, it introduces an additional file (`mockModule.js`) which is not necessary for the task described in the prompt.
- The instructions for overriding the mock in the test file are correct but slightly less straightforward compared to Assistant A's approach.
- The response is relevant but slightly less concise due to the additional file and steps.

**Final Verdict:**
Assistant A's answer is more straightforward and directly addresses the user prompt without introducing unnecessary steps. Therefore, it is slightly better.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
