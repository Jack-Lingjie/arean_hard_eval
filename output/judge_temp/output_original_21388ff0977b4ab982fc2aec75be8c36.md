If you forgot to withdraw the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) from your inherited IRA account during a particular year, you can take the following steps to minimize the penalties:

1. **Withdraw the Missed RMD Immediately**: As soon as you realize the mistake, withdraw the missed RMD amount. This shows the IRS that you are taking steps to correct the oversight.

2. **File IRS Form 5329**: You need to file IRS Form 5329, "Additional Taxes on Qualified Plans (Including IRAs) and Other Tax-Favored Accounts," with your tax return for the year in which the RMD was missed. This form is used to report the 50% excise tax on the missed RMD.

3. **Request a Waiver of the Penalty**: On Form 5329, you can request a waiver of the 50% excise tax by providing a reasonable explanation for the missed RMD and showing that you have taken steps to correct the error. Attach a letter to Form 5329 explaining the reason for the missed RMD, the steps you have taken to correct the mistake, and a request for a waiver of the penalty. The IRS will review your request and may waive the penalty if they find your explanation reasonable.

4. **Consult a Tax Professional**: It's advisable to consult with a tax advisor or accountant who is familiar with your specific situation and can provide personalized advice on how to minimize penalties and ensure compliance with tax laws.

By taking these steps, you can demonstrate to the IRS that the missed RMD was an oversight and that you are taking corrective actions, which may help in getting the penalty waived.
