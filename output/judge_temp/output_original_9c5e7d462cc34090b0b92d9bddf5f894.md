To find the package with the biggest volume that can be shipped under the given constraint, we need to maximize the volume of a rectangular box where the sum of the shortest and longest sides is less than 50 cm.

Let's denote the dimensions of the box as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) such that \(x \leq y \leq z\). The constraint is \(x + z < 50\).

The volume \(V\) of the box is given by:
\[ V = x \times y \times z \]

To maximize the volume, we can assume that \(x\) and \(y\) are equal (i.e., \(x = y\)) to create a square base, which often yields a larger volume for a given perimeter constraint. Thus, the volume equation becomes:
\[ V = x^2 \times z \]

Given the constraint \(x + z < 50\), we can express \(z\) as:
\[ z < 50 - x \]

Substituting this into the volume equation, we get:
\[ V = x^2 \times (50 - x) \]

To find the maximum volume, we take the derivative of \(V\) with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dV}{dx} = 2x(50 - x) - x^2 = 0 \]

Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[ 2x(50 - x) - x^2 = 0 \]
\[ 100x - 2x^2 - x^2 = 0 \]
\[ 100x - 3x^2 = 0 \]
\[ x(100 - 3x) = 0 \]

Since \(x = 0\) is not a feasible solution, we have:
\[ 100 - 3x = 0 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \, \text{cm} \]

Thus, the dimensions of the package with the biggest volume are approximately:
\[ x = y \approx 16.67 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ z \approx 50 - 16.67 = 33.33 \, \text{cm} \]

The maximum volume is:
\[ V \approx 16.67 \times 16.67 \times 33.33 \approx 9,259.26 \, \text{cubic centimeters} \]

Therefore, the package with the biggest volume that can be shipped under the given constraint has dimensions approximately 16.67 cm x 16.67 cm x 33.33 cm, and the volume is approximately 9,259.26 cubic centimeters.
