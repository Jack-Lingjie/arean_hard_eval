Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The entities and relationships are correctly identified and formatted in valid JSON.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response is directly relevant to the prompt and provides the required structured information.
3. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and does not include any unnecessary text.
4. **Completeness**: The response includes all the entities and relationships mentioned in the text passage.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The entities and relationships are mostly correct, but there are some missing entities and relationships. For example, the years (1997, 2004, 2008, 2012) and the political party (Republican) are missing.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response includes unnecessary text and formatting that was explicitly asked to be excluded in the prompt.
3. **Conciseness**: The response is not concise due to the inclusion of extra text and formatting.
4. **Completeness**: The response is missing some entities and relationships that are present in the text passage.

### Final Verdict:
Assistant A's answer is more accurate, complete, and adheres to the prompt's requirements better than Assistant B's answer.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
