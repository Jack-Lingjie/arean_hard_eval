To get all the links from a website, you can use the `requests` library to fetch the website content and `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library to parse the HTML and extract the links. Here is a small Python function to achieve this:

First, ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Now, you can use the following function:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_all_links(url):
    """
    Retrieves all links from a given website.

    Args:
    - url (str): The URL of the website.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of all links found on the website.
    """
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an HTTPError for bad responses
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        links = [a.get('href') for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]
        return links
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching the website: {e}")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return []

# Example usage
url = "https://example.com"
links = get_all_links(url)
print(links)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`requests.get(url)`**: Sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.
2. **`response.raise_for_status()`**: Raises an HTTPError if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code.
3. **`BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')`**: Parses the HTML content of the webpage.
4. **`soup.find_all('a', href=True)`**: Finds all HTML anchor tags (`<a>`) with an `href` attribute.
5. **`[a.get('href') for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]`**: Extracts the `href` values from the anchor tags.

This function returns a list of all links found on the website and handles exceptions for failed requests and parsing errors.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation:

**Assistant A's Answer:**
1. **Correctness**: The function provided by Assistant A is correct and works as intended. It uses `requests` to fetch the webpage and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract links.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and provides a clear explanation and example usage.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.
5. **Error Handling**: Assistant A includes basic error handling but does not use `response.raise_for_status()` to handle HTTP errors more effectively.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
1. **Correctness**: The function provided by Assistant B is also correct and works as intended. It uses `requests` to fetch the webpage and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract links.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and provides a clear explanation and example usage.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.
5. **Error Handling**: Assistant B includes better error handling by using `response.raise_for_status()` to handle HTTP errors more effectively.

### Verdict:
Both answers are quite similar in terms of correctness, helpfulness, and relevance. However, Assistant B's answer includes a more robust error handling mechanism with `response.raise_for_status()`, which is a slight improvement over Assistant A's answer.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
