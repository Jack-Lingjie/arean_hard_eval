To calculate Pi using JavaScript, there are several methods available. Here are three common approaches:

### Method 1: Leibniz Formula for Pi
The Leibniz formula for Pi is an infinite series that converges to Pi. Here is a simple implementation:

```javascript
function calculatePi(iterations) {
  let pi = 0;
  let denominator = 1;

  for (let i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      pi += 4 / denominator;
    } else {
      pi -= 4 / denominator;
    }
    denominator += 2;
  }

  return pi;
}

const iterations = 1000000; // Increase this number for better accuracy
const pi = calculatePi(iterations);
console.log(pi);
```

### Method 2: Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe (BBP) Formula
The BBP formula allows you to calculate Pi to a high degree of precision and can calculate any binary digit of Pi.

```javascript
function calculatePi(n) {
  let pi = 0;
  for (let k = 0; k <= n; k++) {
    pi += 1 / Math.pow(16, k) * (
      4 / (8 * k + 1) -
      2 / (8 * k + 4) -
      1 / (8 * k + 5) -
      1 / (8 * k + 6)
    );
  }
  return pi;
}

// Example usage:
const pi = calculatePi(100);
console.log(pi);
```

### Method 3: Monte Carlo Method
The Monte Carlo method uses random sampling to estimate the value of Pi.

```javascript
function calculatePi(numPoints) {
  let pointsInsideCircle = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < numPoints; i++) {
    const x = Math.random();
    const y = Math.random();

    if (x * x + y * y <= 1) {
      pointsInsideCircle++;
    }
  }

  return 4 * pointsInsideCircle / numPoints;
}

// Example usage:
const pi = calculatePi(1000000);
console.log(pi);
```

Each of these methods has its own advantages and trade-offs. The Leibniz formula is simple but converges slowly. The BBP formula is more complex but can calculate Pi to a high degree of precision. The Monte Carlo method is probabilistic and can be useful for educational purposes or when a simple approximation is sufficient.
