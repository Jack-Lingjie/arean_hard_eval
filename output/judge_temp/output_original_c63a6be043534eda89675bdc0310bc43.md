To address the issue of exceeding the model's maximum context length of 2048 tokens, you can take several approaches:

1. **Reduce Input Length**: Shorten the input text to fit within the 2048-token limit. This can be done by summarizing or removing less important parts of the text.

2. **Split Input Text**: Divide the input text into smaller chunks that each fit within the 2048-token limit. Process each chunk separately and then combine the results if necessary.

3. **Truncate Input Text**: If reducing or splitting the text is not feasible, you can truncate the text to ensure it fits within the token limit. Be aware that this may result in loss of information.

Here is an example in Python using the `transformers` library to truncate the input text:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load the tokenizer for your model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your_pretrained_model_name")

# Define the maximum number of tokens
max_tokens = 2048

# Your input text
input_text = "your_long_input_text_here"

# Encode and truncate the input text
encoded_input = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=max_tokens)

# Decode the truncated input to verify
truncated_text = tokenizer.decode(encoded_input[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(truncated_text)
```

This code ensures that the input text is truncated to fit within the model's maximum context length of 2048 tokens.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Model Configuration**: Some models may allow increasing the context length through configuration settings. Check the model's documentation to see if this is possible.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage cases where the input text exceeds the token limit, ensuring your application can handle such scenarios gracefully.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage the input text to fit within the model's constraints and avoid the token limit error.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The answer correctly identifies the need to reduce the input text to fit within the 2048-token limit and provides a Python example using the `transformers` library.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response is helpful as it provides clear steps and a code example to truncate the input text.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt, focusing on reducing the input text length.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
1. **Correctness**: The answer correctly identifies the need to reduce the input text and provides two options: splitting the input text and increasing the model's context length.
2. **Helpfulness**: The response is helpful as it provides multiple solutions and example code for both options.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt, addressing the issue of exceeding the token limit.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is slightly more verbose but provides comprehensive solutions.
