To solve the equation \(5x^2 + 3x^2 = 8\):

1. Combine like terms:
   \[5x^2 + 3x^2 = 8x^2\]

2. Set the equation equal to 8:
   \[8x^2 = 8\]

3. Divide both sides by 8:
   \[x^2 = 1\]

4. Take the square root of both sides:
   \[x = \pm 1\]

Since \(x\) represents the length of a line segment, it must be non-negative. Therefore, the solution is:
\[x = 1\]

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

**Assistant A's Answer:**
- Correctly simplifies the equation and solves for \(x\).
- Correctly identifies that \(x\) must be positive since it represents the length of a line segment.
- The explanation is clear and concise.

**Assistant B's Answer:**
- Correctly simplifies the equation and solves for \(x\).
- Correctly identifies that \(x\) must be positive since it represents the length of a line segment.
- The explanation is clear and concise, with a slight emphasis on the interpretation of \(x\) as a length.

Both assistants provided accurate and clear solutions to the problem. However, Assistant B's answer includes a bit more detail in the interpretation section, which might be slightly more helpful for understanding why negative values are not applicable in this context.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
