To undo a Docker build and return to the state before running the `docker build .` command, you need to remove the Docker image that was created. Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Identify the Image ID**:
   First, find the image ID of the image you just built. You can do this by listing all Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```
   Look for the image you built and note its IMAGE ID.

2. **Remove the Image**:
   Once you have the IMAGE ID, you can remove the image using the `docker rmi` command:
   ```bash
   docker rmi <IMAGE_ID>
   ```
   Replace `<IMAGE_ID>` with the actual image ID you found in the previous step.

By removing the image, you effectively revert to the state before you ran the `docker build .` command. Note that this does not undo any changes made to the Dockerfile or other files in your project directory.

### Example
Assuming the IMAGE ID of the built image is `abc123`, you would run:
```bash
docker rmi abc123
```

This will delete the image and free up the space it was using.

### Additional Considerations
- If there are any containers running from the image, you will need to stop and remove them before you can remove the image.
- Use `docker ps -a` to list all containers and `docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>` to remove any containers if necessary.

By following these steps, you can undo the Docker build and return to the state before the build was executed.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer
1. **Correctness**: The answer correctly identifies that you cannot directly "undo" a Docker build but can remove the created image.
2. **Helpfulness**: The steps provided are clear and directly address the user's question.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant and focused on the task of removing the built image.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer
1. **Correctness**: The answer provides a more complex set of steps, including stopping and removing containers, which is not directly related to undoing a build.
2. **Helpfulness**: The steps are more elaborate than necessary and might confuse the user.
3. **Relevance**: The answer includes steps that are not strictly necessary for undoing a build, such as stopping and removing all containers and images.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is more verbose and includes unnecessary steps.

### Final Verdict
Assistant A's answer is more focused, relevant, and concise in addressing the user's question about undoing a Docker build by removing the created image.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
