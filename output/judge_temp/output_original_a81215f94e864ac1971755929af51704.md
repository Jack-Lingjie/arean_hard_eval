### My Answer

To improve the Gherkin (Cucumber tests) and move the text into separate scenarios, I would break down the original scenario into multiple, more focused scenarios. Here is the improved version:

```gherkin
Scenario: Confirm Contour button visibility
  Given the user confirms the contours
  Then the Confirm Contour button becomes invisible

Scenario: Markers visibility in navigation control
  Given the user confirms the contours
  Then the following markers are visible in the navigation control:
    | Marker               | View    |
    | ES                   | Current |
    | OAC                  | Current |
    | OAC                  | Both    |
    | LA Major Axis Length | Both    | cm  |

Scenario: Global LAS values visibility
  Given the user confirms the contours
  Then the following Global LAS values are shown for both views:
    | LAS Type | View    |
    | LAS-R    | Current |
    | LAS-R    | Both    |
    | LAS-CD   | Current |
    | LAS-CD   | Both    |
    | LAS-CT   | Current |
    | LAS-CT   | Both    |

Scenario: Information visibility in current view
  Given the user confirms the contours
  Then the following information is shown in the current view:
    | Frame Number | Marker | Indication |
    | Auto         | ES     |            |
    | Auto         | OAC    |            |
    | Heartrate    |        |            |

Scenario: Overall statistics visibility
  Given the user confirms the contours
  Then the following overall statistics are shown:
    | Statistic        | Value  |
    | Average HR       | bpm    |
    | Delta HR         | bpm    |
    | Minimum Framerate | fps    |
```

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer

Assistant A's answer is very similar to my own. It correctly breaks down the original scenario into multiple, more focused scenarios. The structure and content are clear and concise, and it maintains the integrity of the original information.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer

Assistant B's answer also breaks down the original scenario into multiple scenarios. However, it includes an unnecessary section titled "Improved Gherkin Scenario: Confirm Contour" which repeats the original scenario before breaking it down. This makes the response more verbose and less concise. The separate scenarios are well-structured but the additional section adds unnecessary complexity.

### Final Verdict

Both assistants provided correct and relevant answers, but Assistant A's response is more concise and directly addresses the prompt without adding unnecessary sections.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
