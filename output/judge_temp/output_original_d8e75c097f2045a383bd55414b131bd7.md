To perform continuous delta hedging with a neural network in Python, you need to follow several steps, including data preparation, model training, delta calculation, and hedging strategy implementation. Here is a detailed guide:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
   from jax import grad
   import jax.numpy as jnp
   ```

2. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**:
   Assuming you have a dataset with features like stock price, strike price, time to maturity, implied volatility, and option price:
   ```python
   # Load the dataset
   data = pd.read_csv('options_data.csv')

   # Scale the features
   scaler = MinMaxScaler()
   scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

   # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(scaled_data[:, :-1], scaled_data[:, -1], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

3. **Build and Train the Neural Network**:
   ```python
   # Define the neural network model
   model = Sequential()
   model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
   model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
   model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear'))

   # Compile the model
   model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

   # Train the model
   history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=100, batch_size=32)
   ```

4. **Calculate the Delta**:
   To calculate the delta, you need to find the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the stock price:
   ```python
   def option_price_nn(params, S, K, T, sigma):
       x = jnp.array([S, K, T, sigma])
       x = scaler.transform(x.reshape(1, -1))
       return model.predict(x).item()

   # Calculate the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the stock price
   delta_nn = grad(option_price_nn, argnums=1)
   ```

5. **Perform Continuous Delta Hedging**:
   Now that you have the delta, you can perform continuous delta hedging by adjusting your position in the underlying asset based on the predicted delta:
   ```python
   # Define the initial parameters
   S = 100  # Stock price
   K = 100  # Strike price
   T = 30 / 365  # Time to maturity
   sigma = 0.2  # Implied volatility

   # Calculate the initial delta
   initial_delta = delta_nn(None, S, K, T, sigma)

   # Adjust your position in the underlying asset based on the predicted delta
   hedge_position = -initial_delta * S

   # Update the stock price, time to maturity, and recalculate the delta
   S_new = 102
   T_new = 29 / 365
   new_delta = delta_nn(None, S_new, K, T_new, sigma)

   # Adjust your position in the underlying asset based on the new predicted delta
   hedge_position_new = -new_delta * S_new
   ```

You can repeat the last step to continuously adjust your position in the underlying asset based on the predicted delta. Note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to consider transaction costs and other factors in a real-world scenario.
