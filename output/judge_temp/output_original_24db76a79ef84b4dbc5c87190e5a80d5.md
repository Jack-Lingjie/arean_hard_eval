Here is my response to the user prompt:

| Method Number | Method Description | Expected Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Set a consistent morning routine. | Establishing a routine helps you start your day with a sense of purpose and reduces decision fatigue. |
| 2 | Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix. | By categorizing tasks as urgent/important, you can focus on what truly matters and avoid procrastination. |
| 3 | Break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. | Dividing tasks into smaller parts makes them less overwhelming and easier to start. |
| 4 | Use the Pomodoro Technique for time management. | Working in short, focused intervals with breaks in between increases productivity and reduces burnout. |
| 5 | Eliminate distractions by creating a dedicated workspace. | A clutter-free and distraction-free environment helps maintain focus and productivity. |
