To solve the problem of distributing the power equally among the three generators, each needing to be at 60kW, and given the constraints of only being able to perform three power switches, here is a step-by-step solution:

1. **Initial Power Distribution:**
   - Generator A: 30kW
   - Generator B: 100kW
   - Generator C: 50kW

2. **Available Power Transfer Options:**
   - Transfer 30kW from A to B
   - Transfer 10kW from A to C
   - Transfer 20kW from B to A
   - Transfer 20kW from B to C
   - Transfer 10kW from C to A

3. **Step-by-Step Solution:**

   - **First Transfer:** Transfer 30kW from A to B.
     - Generator A: 0kW
     - Generator B: 130kW
     - Generator C: 50kW

   - **Second Transfer:** Transfer 20kW from B to A.
     - Generator A: 20kW
     - Generator B: 110kW
     - Generator C: 50kW

   - **Third Transfer:** Transfer 10kW from B to C.
     - Generator A: 20kW
     - Generator B: 100kW
     - Generator C: 60kW

4. **Final Power Distribution:**
   - Generator A: 20kW
   - Generator B: 100kW
   - Generator C: 60kW

After these three transfers, Generator C is at the desired 60kW, but Generators A and B are not at 60kW. Given the constraints of only three switches and the specific transfer options, it is not possible to achieve exactly 60kW for all three generators.

### Conclusion:
It is not possible to achieve the goal of having all three generators at 60kW each with only three switches and the given power transfer options.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation:

**Assistant A:**
- Correctly identifies the initial power distribution.
- Correctly performs the three transfers.
- Correctly concludes that it is not possible to achieve 60kW for all generators with the given constraints.
- The explanation is clear and concise.

**Assistant B:**
- Provides a detailed breakdown of the problem and constraints.
- Performs the transfers but makes an error in the final power distribution.
- Incorrectly concludes that the final distribution meets the requirements.
- The explanation is detailed but contains inaccuracies.

### Verdict:
Assistant A provides a correct and concise solution, while Assistant B makes an error in the final power distribution and conclusion.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
