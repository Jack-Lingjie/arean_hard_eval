Here is my answer to the prompt:

```javascript
function makeRequest(url, retries = 3) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const attemptRequest = (remainingRetries) => {
      const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open('GET', url, true);

      xhr.onload = () => {
        if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
          resolve(xhr.responseText);
        } else {
          if (remainingRetries > 0) {
            attemptRequest(remainingRetries - 1);
          } else {
            reject(new Error('Request failed after 3 retries'));
          }
        }
      };

      xhr.onerror = () => {
        if (remainingRetries > 0) {
          attemptRequest(remainingRetries - 1);
        } else {
          reject(new Error('Request failed after 3 retries'));
        }
      };

      xhr.send();
    };

    attemptRequest(retries);
  });
}

// Usage example:
makeRequest('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('Data:', data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

This function uses the `XMLHttpRequest` API to make a request to the specified URL. If the request fails or returns a non-successful status code, it will retry the request up to 3 times before rejecting the promise.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:

1. **Correctness**: The function provided by Assistant A is mostly correct. It uses recursion to retry the request up to 3 times.
2. **Helpfulness**: The function correctly retries the request and handles both `onload` and `onerror` events.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is concise and to the point.
5. **Missing Information**: The function does not handle the case where the request fails after 3 retries correctly. It should reject the promise instead of resolving it with another request.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:

1. **Correctness**: The function provided by Assistant B is also mostly correct. It uses recursion to retry the request up to 3 times.
2. **Helpfulness**: The function correctly retries the request and handles both `onload` and `onerror` events.
3. **Relevance**: The response is relevant to the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The response is clear but slightly more verbose than necessary.
5. **Missing Information**: The function does not correctly handle the promise resolution and rejection within the recursive function. The `resolve` and `reject` calls should be passed down to the recursive function.

### Conclusion:

Both assistants provided mostly correct answers, but Assistant A's response is slightly better because it is more concise and directly addresses the prompt without unnecessary verbosity.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
