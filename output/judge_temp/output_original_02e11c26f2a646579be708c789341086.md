To create a simple substring-match CLI app in Rust, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
1. **Install Rust**: If you haven't already, install Rust using the official installer from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2. **Choose an IDE or Text Editor**: Select a preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or text editor for coding.

### Step 2: Create a New Rust Project
1. **Use Cargo**: Cargo is Rust's package manager. It will help you manage dependencies and build your project.

```bash
cargo new substring_match
cd substring_match
```

### Step 3: Write the Code
1. **`src/main.rs`**: This is where your code will live.

```rust
use std::env;
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    // Get command line arguments
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    // Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
    if args.len() != 2 {
        eprintln!("Usage: {} <substring>", args[0]);
        std::process::exit(1);
    }

    // Get the substring to search for
    let substring = &args[1];

    // Read lines from stdin and search for the substring
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    for line in stdin.lock().lines() {
        let line = line.unwrap();
        if line.contains(substring) {
            println!("{}", line);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Build and Run Your Code
1. **Build and Run**: Use Cargo to build and run your code.

```bash
cargo run -- "your search pattern"
```

### Example Use Case
1. **Test your CLI app**: Provide some input to test the app.

```bash
echo -e "Hello, World!\nRust is awesome!" | cargo run -- "Rust"
```

This should output:

```
Rust is awesome!
```

### Conclusion
This guide has walked you through creating a simple substring-match CLI app in Rust. You've learned how to:
- Set up your environment
- Create a new Rust project
- Write the code
- Build and run your code

This is a basic example to get you started. You can expand upon this by adding more features, such as handling multiple files or patterns.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer
1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant A is correct and functional. It reads from stdin and matches the substring.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful and walks through the steps clearly.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt and focuses on creating a simple CLI app.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer
1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant B is also correct but introduces file reading, which is more complex than required by the prompt.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful but slightly deviates from the simplicity requested by the user.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant but adds unnecessary complexity by involving file reading.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is clear but slightly more verbose due to the additional complexity.

### Final Verdict
Assistant A's answer is more aligned with the user's request for a simple substring-match CLI app. It sticks to reading from stdin and matching a substring, which is exactly what the user asked for.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
