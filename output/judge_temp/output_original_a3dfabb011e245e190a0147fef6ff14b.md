To solve the problem of finding the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s in a binary array, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the difference between the number of 1s and 0s encountered so far. This difference will be used as the key, and the index will be the value. If the same difference is encountered again, it means that there is a subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s between the two indices.

Here is a Python function to achieve this:

```python
def findMaxLength(nums):
    count = 0
    max_length = 0
    diff_dict = {0: -1}

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num == 0:
            count -= 1
        else:
            count += 1

        if count in diff_dict:
            max_length = max(max_length, i - diff_dict[count])
        else:
            diff_dict[count] = i

    return max_length
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the difference between the number of 1s and 0s.
   - `max_length` is initialized to 0. This will store the maximum length of the subarray found.
   - `diff_dict` is initialized with `{0: -1}`. This dictionary will store the first occurrence of each count value.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the array, update the `count` by decrementing it if the element is 0 and incrementing it if the element is 1.
   - Check if the current `count` is already in `diff_dict`. If it is, calculate the length of the subarray from the first occurrence of this count to the current index and update `max_length` if this length is greater than the current `max_length`.
   - If the current `count` is not in `diff_dict`, add it with the current index as its value.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns `max_length`, which is the length of the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.

### Example Usage:
```python
nums1 = [0, 1]
print(findMaxLength(nums1))  # Output: 2

nums2 = [0, 1, 0]
print(findMaxLength(nums2))  # Output: 2

nums3 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
print(findMaxLength(nums3))  # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element in the array is processed once.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the `diff_dict` dictionary.
