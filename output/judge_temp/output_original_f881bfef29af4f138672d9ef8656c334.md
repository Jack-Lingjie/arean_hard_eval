To implement a system that sends email alerts if a job takes too long to execute, while addressing the concerns of varying execution times based on the day of the week, global trends, and sudden jumps, you can follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Collect historical execution time data for each job, including timestamps and relevant contextual information (e.g., day of the week, type of transaction).
   - Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and any necessary transformations.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create features that capture the day of the week, time of day, and any other relevant contextual information.
   - Calculate rolling statistics (e.g., rolling mean, rolling standard deviation) to capture recent trends in execution time.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Choose a suitable model that can handle time series data and account for seasonality, trends, and sudden jumps. Some options include ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS), or machine learning models like LSTM or Prophet.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets, and train the model on the training set.

4. **Model Evaluation and Tuning:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error).
   - Fine-tune the model's parameters to improve its performance, if necessary.

5. **Anomaly Detection and Threshold Setting:**
   - Use the trained model to predict future execution times and calculate the residuals (i.e., the difference between actual and predicted execution times).
   - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the residuals, and set a threshold for alerting based on a chosen confidence level (e.g., 99% confidence interval).

6. **Alerting System:**
   - Monitor the execution times of jobs in real-time.
   - Compare the actual execution time with the predicted execution time from the model.
   - If the difference between the actual and predicted execution time exceeds the threshold, send an email alert.

7. **Model Updating and Maintenance:**
   - Periodically update the model with new data to ensure it stays up-to-date with the latest trends and patterns.
   - Monitor the model's performance and adjust the threshold or retrain the model as needed.

**Addressing Specific Concerns:**

1. **Day of the Week:**
   - Incorporate day-of-week features into the model to account for variations in execution time based on the day of the week.

2. **Global Trends:**
   - Use models that can capture trends over time, such as ARIMA or Prophet, to account for global upward trends in execution time.

3. **Sudden Jumps:**
   - Implement anomaly detection techniques to identify and handle sudden jumps in execution time. This can include statistical process control (SPC) methods or machine learning-based anomaly detection.

By following these steps, you can create a system that autonomously determines what is "too long" for a job's execution time and sends email alerts accordingly. This approach addresses the concerns of varying execution times based on the day of the week, global trends, and sudden jumps in execution time.
