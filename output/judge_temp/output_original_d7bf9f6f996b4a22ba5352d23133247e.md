To create an effective prompt structure for an AI, follow these guidelines:

1. **Context**: Start by providing background information or context to help the AI understand the scenario or subject matter. This sets the stage for the task.

2. **Task**: Clearly define the specific task or question you want the AI to address. Ensure that the instructions are precise and unambiguous.

3. **Format**: Specify the desired format or structure of the response. This could include length, style, or any particular formatting requirements.

4. **Constraints**: Mention any limitations or constraints that the AI should consider while generating the response. This could include time limits, word counts, or specific rules.

5. **Examples (Optional)**: Provide examples of the desired output to give the AI a clearer understanding of your expectations.

Here is a template you can use to relay instructions to an AI:

```
Context: [Provide context or background information]
Task: [State the specific task or question]
Format: [Specify the desired format or structure]
Constraints: [Mention any limitations or constraints]
Examples (Optional): [Provide examples of desired output]
```

Replace the bracketed sections with your specific instructions to guide the AI effectively.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Assistant A's Answer
1. **Context**: Included.
2. **Task**: Included.
3. **Format**: Included.
4. **Constraints**: Included.
5. **Examples (Optional)**: Included.

Assistant A provides a clear and concise structure, covering all essential elements. The template is straightforward and easy to follow.

### Assistant B's Answer
1. **Clear Objective**: Included (Define the Task, Provide Context).
2. **Specific Requirements**: Included (Detail the Output, Include Constraints).
3. **Relevant Information**: Included (Provide Necessary Data, Explain Key Concepts).
4. **Evaluation Criteria**: Included (Define Success, Specify Evaluation Metrics).
5. **Additional Guidance**: Included (Offer Examples, Clarify Ambiguities).

Assistant B's response is more detailed and includes additional elements like evaluation criteria and additional guidance, which can be beneficial but also makes the structure more complex.

### Evaluation
- **Helpfulness**: Both responses are helpful, but Assistant B provides more detailed guidance.
- **Relevance**: Both responses are relevant to the prompt.
- **Conciseness**: Assistant A is more concise, while Assistant B is more detailed.
- **Creativity and Novelty**: Assistant B shows more creativity by including evaluation criteria and additional guidance.

### Verdict
While both responses are good, Assistant B's answer is more comprehensive and provides additional useful elements that can help in crafting more effective prompts.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
