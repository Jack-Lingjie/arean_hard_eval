To create a Laravel Middleware that blocks users whose IP is not in the allowed IP array, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Middleware:**
   Use the Artisan command to generate a new middleware file.
   ```bash
   php artisan make:middleware CheckIPMiddleware
   ```

2. **Define the Middleware:**
   Open the newly created middleware file located at `app/Http/Middleware/CheckIPMiddleware.php` and update the `handle` method as follows:
   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Http\Middleware;

   use Closure;
   use Illuminate\Http\Request;

   class CheckIPMiddleware
   {
       /**
        * The list of allowed IP addresses.
        *
        * @var array
        */
       protected $allowedIPs = [
           '127.0.0.1',
           '192.168.1.1',
           // Add more allowed IPs here
       ];

       /**
        * Handle an incoming request.
        *
        * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
        * @param  \Closure  $next
        * @return mixed
        */
       public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
       {
           if (!in_array($request->ip(), $this->allowedIPs)) {
               // If the user's IP is not in the allowed IPs list, return a 403 Forbidden response
               return response('Forbidden', 403);
           }

           return $next($request);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Register the Middleware:**
   Add the middleware to the `$routeMiddleware` array in `app/Http/Kernel.php`:
   ```php
   protected $routeMiddleware = [
       // ...
       'check_ip' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckIPMiddleware::class,
   ];
   ```

4. **Apply the Middleware:**
   Apply the middleware to your routes in `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php`:
   ```php
   Route::middleware(['check_ip'])->group(function () {
       // Add your routes here that should be protected by the IP check
   });
   ```

Now, only users with IP addresses in the `$allowedIPs` array will be able to access the routes protected by the `check_ip` middleware.
