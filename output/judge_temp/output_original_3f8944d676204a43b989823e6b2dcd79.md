To utilize multiple GPUs in a PyTorch program, you can use the `torch.nn.DataParallel` module, which helps distribute your model across all available GPUs. Here’s a step-by-step guide to modify your code:

1. **Import Necessary Modules:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
```

2. **Wrap Your Model with `nn.DataParallel`:**

Assuming you have a model called `MyModel`, you can wrap it with `nn.DataParallel` to enable multi-GPU usage.

```python
model = MyModel()
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    print(f"Using {torch.cuda.device_count()} GPUs")
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
```

3. **Move Your Model to the GPU:**

Ensure your model is moved to the GPU.

```python
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
```

4. **Move Your Input Data to the GPU:**

When processing your input data, make sure to move it to the GPU as well.

```python
inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
```

5. **DataLoader Configuration (Optional):**

If you are using a DataLoader, you can configure it to use multiple workers for better performance.

```python
import torch.utils.data as data_utils

data_loader = data_utils.DataLoader(
    your_dataset,
    batch_size=32,
    num_workers=4,  # Adjust based on your system's capabilities
    pin_memory=True
)
```

6. **Training Loop Example:**

Here’s an example of how to integrate these steps into a training loop.

```python
for inputs, labels in data_loader:
    inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
    
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

By following these steps, your PyTorch program should be able to utilize all available GPUs for training.
