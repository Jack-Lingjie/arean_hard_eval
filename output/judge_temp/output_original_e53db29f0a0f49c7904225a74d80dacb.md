Here is the correct translation of the given code into proper Rust:

```rust
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let num = add(3, 4);
    println!("{}", num);
}
```

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:
- The code provided by Assistant A is correct and properly formatted.
- It translates the given code into proper Rust syntax without any errors.
- The `println!` macro is correctly used with the format string `"{}"` to print the value of `num`.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:
- The code provided by Assistant B is also correct and properly formatted.
- It includes an explanation of the code, which is helpful for understanding.
- The explanation covers the purpose of the `enum`, the `add` function, and the `main` function.
- The `println!` macro is correctly used with the format string `"{}"` to print the value of `num`.

### Comparison:
- Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided correct and properly formatted Rust code.
- Assistant B included an explanation, which adds value by helping the user understand the code better.
- Assistant A's response is more concise, while Assistant B's response is more detailed.

Given that both responses are correct but Assistant B provides additional helpful information, the better response is from Assistant B.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
