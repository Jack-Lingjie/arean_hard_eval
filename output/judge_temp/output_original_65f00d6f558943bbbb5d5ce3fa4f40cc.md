Here is my own answer to the prompt:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public class SingleEntryChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = List.of("example"); // Change the list content to test different scenarios

        try {
            String result = checkSingleEntry(list);
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static <T> T checkSingleEntry(List<T> list) throws Exception {
        Optional<T> result = list.stream()
                .reduce((a, b) -> {
                    throw new IllegalStateException("More than one entry found");
                });

        return result.orElse(null);
    }
}
```

This code defines a `checkSingleEntry` method that takes a list as input and returns the single entry if there's exactly one, null if there's no entry, and throws an exception if there are more than one entries. The main method demonstrates how to use this method and handle the exception.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:

1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant A is correct. It uses the `reduce` method to check if there is more than one entry and throws an exception if so. It returns the single entry if there is exactly one, and returns null if the list is empty.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is helpful as it directly addresses the prompt and provides a working solution.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is relevant to the prompt and includes a main method to demonstrate usage.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is concise and to the point.

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:

1. **Correctness**: The code provided by Assistant B has a logical flaw. The `validateSingleEntry` method collects the list into another list and then streams it again, which is unnecessary and does not correctly handle the case of more than one entry. The `validateSingleEntryOrNull` method does not throw an exception for more than one entry, which is not what the prompt asked for.
2. **Helpfulness**: The answer is less helpful because it does not fully meet the requirements of the prompt.
3. **Relevance**: The answer is somewhat relevant but includes unnecessary complexity and does not fully address the prompt.
4. **Conciseness**: The answer is less concise due to the additional method and unnecessary list collection.

### Final Verdict:

Assistant A's answer is more accurate and directly addresses the prompt requirements without unnecessary complexity.

My final verdict is: [[A>>B]]
