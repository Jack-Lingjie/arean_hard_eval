Here is my translation of the prompt into rigorous Lojban:

"mi tavla fi la paris. fo la glibau do poi se cmima la djane noi ba ciska lo xatra"

Explanation:
- "mi tavla" means "I talk."
- "fi la paris." specifies the topic as Paris.
- "fo la glibau" specifies the language as English.
- "do poi se cmima la djane" means "to someone related to Jane."
- "noi ba ciska lo xatra" means "who is about to write a letter."

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Assistant A's Answer:
"mi tavla fi la paris. fo la glibau do poi se cmima la djanys. noi ba ciska lo xatra"

### Assistant B's Answer:
