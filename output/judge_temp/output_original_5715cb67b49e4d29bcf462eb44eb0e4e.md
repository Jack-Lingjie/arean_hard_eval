To prove that there are infinitely many irrational numbers, we can use a proof by contradiction or a constructive proof. Here is a constructive proof:

1. **Definition of Irrational Numbers**: An irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers and \(b \neq 0\).

2. **Existence of Irrational Numbers**: We know that irrational numbers exist. For example, \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.

3. **Constructing More Irrational Numbers**:
   - Consider the number \(\sqrt{2}\). We know it is irrational.
   - Now consider the number \(2\sqrt{2}\). This is also irrational because if it were rational, then \(\sqrt{2}\) would be rational (since dividing a rational number by 2 would yield a rational number), which contradicts the fact that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
   - Similarly, \(3\sqrt{2}\), \(4\sqrt{2}\), and so on are all irrational.

4. **Generalization**:
   - For any positive integer \(n\), \(n\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
   - Since there are infinitely many positive integers \(n\), there are infinitely many irrational numbers of the form \(n\sqrt{2}\).

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there are infinitely many irrational numbers.

This constructive proof shows that by taking multiples of a known irrational number, we can generate infinitely many irrational numbers, thus proving the statement.

**Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer**:
- Assistant A uses a proof by contradiction, which is a valid approach.
- The proof is logically sound and correctly concludes that there are infinitely many irrational numbers.
- However, the explanation involving the sum of squares and square roots might be a bit convoluted and not the most straightforward way to prove the statement.

**Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer**:
- Assistant B's answer is overly verbose and includes unnecessary steps and examples.
- The proof is not clearly structured and includes many redundant examples of irrational numbers without directly addressing the proof.
- The answer lacks a clear logical flow and is not concise.

**Final Verdict**:
Assistant A's answer, while slightly convoluted, is logically sound and directly addresses the proof. Assistant B's answer is overly verbose and lacks a clear logical structure. Therefore, Assistant A's answer is better.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
