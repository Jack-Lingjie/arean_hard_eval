To address the user's prompt, the goal is to have multiple functions in a JavaScript file and be able to call them through a default export object, such as `Util.doSomething` and `Util.doSomethingElse`. Here is a comprehensive answer:

### Using an Object for Default Export

1. **Define your functions:**

```javascript
function doSomething() {
  console.log("Doing something");
}

function doSomethingElse() {
  console.log("Doing something else");
}
```

2. **Create an object that includes these functions:**

```javascript
const Util = {
  doSomething,
  doSomethingElse,
};
```

3. **Export the object as the default export:**

```javascript
export default Util;
```

Your final `.js` file should look like this:

```javascript
function doSomething() {
  console.log("Doing something");
}

function doSomethingElse() {
  console.log("Doing something else");
}

const Util = {
  doSomething,
  doSomethingElse,
};

export default Util;
```

4. **Import and use the default export in another file:**

```javascript
import Util from './your-file-name.js';

Util.doSomething(); // Output: "Doing something"
Util.doSomethingElse(); // Output: "Doing something else"
```

### Alternative Approaches

#### Using a Class

If you prefer an object-oriented approach, you can use a class:

```javascript
class Util {
  doSomething() {
    console.log('Doing something');
  }

  doSomethingElse() {
    console.log('Doing something else');
  }
}

export default new Util();
```

#### Using a Function

For a more functional approach, you can use a function that returns an object:

```javascript
const Util = () => ({
  doSomething() {
    console.log('Doing something');
  },
  doSomethingElse() {
    console.log('Doing something else');
  },
});

export default Util();
```

### Conclusion

Each method allows you to call multiple functions through a default export. The object method is straightforward and commonly used, while the class and function methods offer more flexibility depending on your design preferences.

Now, let's evaluate the responses from Assistant A and Assistant B.

### Evaluation

**Assistant A:**
- Provides a clear and correct method using an object for default export.
- The explanation is straightforward and easy to follow.
- Covers the import and usage in another file.

**Assistant B:**
- Offers multiple methods (object, class, function) to achieve the goal.
- Provides a broader perspective and flexibility in approach.
- The explanations are clear and concise for each method.

### Verdict

Both assistants provide correct and helpful answers. However, Assistant B offers more comprehensive solutions by presenting multiple methods, which can be beneficial for users with different preferences or requirements.

My final verdict is: [[B>A]]
