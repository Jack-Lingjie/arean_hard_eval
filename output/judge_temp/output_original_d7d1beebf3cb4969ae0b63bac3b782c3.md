To design a SQL schema that supports versioning without sacrificing referential integrity, you can use a combination of surrogate keys, versioning columns, and history tables. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Use Surrogate Keys**: Use surrogate primary keys (e.g., auto-incrementing integers or UUIDs) for each table. This allows you to maintain multiple versions of a record without violating primary key constraints.

2. **Add Versioning Columns**: Add columns such as `version_number`, `valid_from`, and `valid_to` to each table. The `version_number` column will store the version of the record, while `valid_from` and `valid_to` will store the time range during which the record is considered valid.

3. **Create History Tables**: For each table, create a corresponding history table that will store the previous versions of the records. The history table should have the same columns as the main table, plus an additional `operation` column to indicate whether the record was inserted, updated, or deleted.

4. **Use Triggers or Application Logic**: Implement triggers or application logic to maintain the history tables. Whenever a record is inserted, updated, or deleted in the main table, the corresponding history table should be updated accordingly.

5. **Enforce Referential Integrity**: Define foreign key constraints between the main tables using the surrogate keys. This will ensure that referential integrity is maintained across different versions of the records.

Here’s an example schema for a simple blog system with versioning:

```sql
CREATE TABLE authors (
    author_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    version_number INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    valid_from TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    valid_to TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE authors_history (
    author_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    version_number INT NOT NULL,
    valid_from TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    valid_to TIMESTAMP,
    operation CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (author_id, version_number)
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
    post_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    author_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    version_number INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    valid_from TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    valid_to TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors (author_id)
);

CREATE TABLE posts_history (
    post_id INT NOT NULL,
    author_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    version_number INT NOT NULL,
    valid_from TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    valid_to TIMESTAMP,
    operation CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (post_id, version_number)
);
```

With this schema, you can maintain multiple versions of authors and posts while preserving referential integrity between them.
