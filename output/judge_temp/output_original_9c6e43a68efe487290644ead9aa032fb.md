To generate a chart using matplotlib in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install matplotlib**: If you haven't already installed matplotlib, you can do so using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

2. **Import the necessary library**:
    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ```

3. **Define your data**: For example, let's use the following data:
    ```python
    x_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    y_data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    ```

4. **Create and customize the chart**: Here, we'll create a simple line chart.
    ```python
    plt.plot(x_data, y_data)
    plt.xlabel('X-axis Label')
    plt.ylabel('Y-axis Label')
    plt.title('Line Chart Example')
    plt.show()
    ```

5. **Alternative chart types**: You can also create other types of charts, such as bar charts or scatter plots. For example, a bar chart:
    ```python
    labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
    values = [10, 15, 7, 12, 20]
    
    plt.bar(labels, values)
    plt.xlabel('Categories')
    plt.ylabel('Values')
    plt.title('Bar Chart Example')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    ```

This code provides a basic example of how to generate and customize charts using matplotlib. You can replace the data and labels with your own to fit your specific needs.
