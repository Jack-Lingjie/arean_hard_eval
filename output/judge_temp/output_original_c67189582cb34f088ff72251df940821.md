- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Reusability
- Scalability
- Maintainability

**1.3 Architectural Views and Perspectives**
- Logical view
- Development view
- Process view
- Physical view
- Scenarios and use cases

**1.4 Quality Attributes in Software Architecture**
- Performance
- Security
- Availability

### Evaluation of Assistant A's Answer:

**Strengths:**
1. Comprehensive coverage of topics.
2. Logical structure and clear breakdown of each class.
3. Inclusion of both fundamental and advanced topics.
4. Practical aspects like case studies and best practices.

**Weaknesses:**
1. Some topics might be too broad to cover in the given time (e.g., all quality attributes in 1.4).

### Evaluation of Assistant B's Answer:

**Strengths:**
1. Clear objectives for each class.
2. Good mix of fundamental and advanced topics.
3. Inclusion of practical applications and case studies.

**Weaknesses:**
1. Some repetition of topics (e.g., microservices and event-driven architecture appear in both Class 1 and Class 2).
2. Less detailed breakdown compared to Assistant A.

### Final Verdict:

Both assistants provided strong answers, but Assistant A's response is more detailed and logically structured, covering a wider range of topics without unnecessary repetition.

My final verdict is: [[A>B]]
