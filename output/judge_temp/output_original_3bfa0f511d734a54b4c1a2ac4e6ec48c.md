To determine the number of lands you should include in your 99-card Magic: The Gathering deck to draw an average of 3 lands in your starting 7-card hand, we can use the hypergeometric distribution. This distribution helps us calculate the probability of drawing a specific number of "successes" (in this case, lands) from a finite population (your deck) without replacement.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Total number of cards in the deck (N): 99
   - Number of lands in the deck (L): This is what we need to find.
   - Number of cards drawn (n): 7
   - Desired number of lands in the starting hand (k): 3

2. **Hypergeometric Distribution Formula:**
   The probability of drawing exactly k lands in a 7-card hand is given by:
   \[
   P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{L}{k} \cdot \binom{N-L}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}
   \]
   where:
   - \(\binom{a}{b}\) is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose b items from a set of a items.

3. **Expected Value:**
   We want the expected value of lands in the 7-card hand to be 3. The expected value (E) for the hypergeometric distribution is given by:
   \[
   E(X) = n \cdot \frac{L}{N}
   \]
   Setting \(E(X) = 3\):
   \[
   3 = 7 \cdot \frac{L}{99}
   \]
   Solving for L:
   \[
   L = \frac{3 \cdot 99}{7} \approx 42.43
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   To draw an average of 3 lands in your starting 7-card hand, you should include approximately 42-43 lands in your 99-card deck. This is a general guideline, and the exact number may vary slightly depending on your specific deck strategy and card choices.

### Verification:
To verify, you can use a hypergeometric calculator or software to check the probability of drawing exactly 3 lands with 42-43 lands in a 99-card deck. This approach ensures that the calculated number of lands aligns with the desired average.

### Practical Consideration:
While the mathematical approach gives a precise number, in practice, you might adjust the number of lands slightly based on playtesting and the specific needs of your deck.
